"My ADHD and OCD are particularly bad and work against eachother all the time. Starting taking medicine and realized I did not want to take anymore medicine than I was already on (2 pills per day). Began taking vitamins, dietary supplements, herbs and found ways to reduce my stress and get more exercise.  Among the 2 dietary supplements I take, this is one of them- 500 mg per day and it's been about 3-4 weeks on it. No side effects and yes, I do believe it works for my pms, adhd, ocd and symptoms of depression. I like it because it is multipurpose and seems to help in several areas.  Without taking as many herbs, supplements and vitamins as I do, I do not believe it would be enough to get me through the day by itself but wow, what a difference. More alert, calmer and much easier to focus day to day. Definitely, absolutely notice a difference without it from the before to the after.  Still waiting 1 or 2 more weeks before I notice a bigger difference.It is also one of the VERY few natural things made for both adhd and ocd at the same time.","

Tried zinc gluconate 50mg tablets three times a day for a week and the cramps completely subsided. Even my skin eczema looks better. Will cut the dose of zinc in a couple of weeks or so back closer to RDA levels to prevent copper deficiency, hopefully the leg cramps will stay away.","

I used zinc oxide ointment daily for my psoriasis  The improvement was very noticeable after 1 month and dramatic after 2 months. The psoriasis had covered large areas of my body.  It cleared up almost completely.  I applied it every night before bed and left on all night. Zinc oxide orally didn't work. Ointment also much more effective than cream. The psoriasis on my scalp cleared up just through the amount I was getting on the rest of my body. Now years later I still get occasional small patches and ointment doesn't work so well perhaps because not getting enough of it now that area affected is small. I sourced the zinc oxide from a veterinary supplies place as a cattle ointment! Could get a large amount relatively cheaply. ,"

Foolishly I figured it would probably be fine, not realizing 50 mg is over the recommended daily amount for anyone. After taking these for several months, I began having abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea and lack of appetite resulting in unexpected  weight loss. Overall I feel pretty lousy and I'm glad I noticed the dosage on my zinc before I took it last night and checked in with webmd to discover that I only require 8 mg daily.

"This supplement has helped me with hair loss. I noticed a reduction on the amount of daily hair  on my white floor since I started taking it. 
I had to pass the broom twice a day and grab the balls of hair to put in the trash, now my hair loss is minimal.
The ""365"" brand offers chelated zinc and contains also some copper. It took me years to find something that worked.  I guess I did not treat the root cause until now and it was mineral deficiency.
Please note I initially purchased the liquid zinc from the ""Benevolent"" brand and that one gave me horrible vertigo. I later noticed this brand not only includes zinc but also Elderberry Fruit, Umckaloabo Root, and Echinacea. I ended spending more than $400 on doctors and the symptoms stopped a couple of days after I stopped taking the liquid zinc. I did not think of the liquid zinc as the cause until I took it again and the vertigo started again. I stopped it for good and I did not experience vertigo ever again.
I have been taking the ""365"" brand which works with no side effects in one month. I will continue using it. ","

"I wish I had found this before having my uterus removed. I continue to have the same PMS symptoms with my cycle and the breast pain/swelling, bloating and water retention increased to an all time high. This is not an wonder pill that works all by itself. I recommend each person works with a qualified natural therapist to do a work up of hormones and endocrine system as well as nutritional deficiencies and sensitivities. I follow an organic diet free of allergens and only take primrose oil on day 14-28 of my cycle (it took time to figure out since I don't have one now) as it helps to boost progesterone. I also take daily vitamins, C, D3/K2/A, B-complex with extra B6, magnesium and natural thyroid. I also took measures in my home and personal products to remove any hormone and endocrine system disruptors that cause estrogen dominance symptoms. Look up Progestelle and Womens Voices for the Earth for help. Any Western GYN who will tell you that primrose oil causes more problems is due to the fact that they have ZERO training or expertise in nutrition and supplementation. They are not trained for wellness/health or an ounce of nutritional knowledge, they are trained to attack symptoms of illness with synthetic pharmaceuticals and surgery. Remember it is a business and they will only use modalities that make money. I should know, I have been a healthcare professional for 20 years and have extended training to the natural way because it is the only way out of this mess. Your body does not recognize synthetic substances with chemicals and additives in pharmaceuticals. At best they just mask the symptoms while your body is now required to deal with another foreign substance when it is already being blasted with chemicals throughout our environment.","

I tried various kinds like black cohosh and everything with the name ""for menopausal symptoms"". Nothing helped, so much so that I was considering to go back on hormone therapy. But then my gynaecologist suggested I try Primrose Oil. I took the Evening Primrose Oil PRAYERFULLY, 2 capsules in the morning and it helped me from day 1! I slept like a baby after many weeks of suffering hot flushes, nite sweats, sore breasts, mood swings and other symptons. ","

WOW I WAS SHOCKED she could tell a difference! I tell mothers when talking about similar issues, 'run' do not walk to buy some. I decided to treat her for the 'period' only and not for the entire month. This worked for her, it may not for everyone. Now we are again buying it for my granddaughter. Hope we get the same wonderful results!!  PS: sure wish I had known about this when I was young...

"My ""Hot Flashes"" had me to the point of feeling Nauseated, they were so overwhelming and unpredictable. I had heard nightmare stories on taking prescription hormone replacement and wanted that as a last resort. I searched the internet for natural remedies and found several testimonies about EVENING PRIMROSE OIL so I tried it. After 2 days of 2000 mg doses the hot flashes are few and far between. I would strongly recommend this to any woman suffering from hot flashes. I'm glad I did and you will be too!","

I have stopped ALL sweating and now only sweat during expected times exercise or out in the heat of Louisiana.  This oil WORKS and works WELL. I encourage every woman to try this, I am 38 years old and I started to have this problem three years ago.  I did not want go ANYWHERE because I knew that peoole would look at me and wonder why I was DRENCHED in sweat while just shopping at a store.

"I have started using Fenugreek Tea as a supplemental Treatment for my Type II diabetes along with Bitter Melon, 6 Months ago.  I have seen very little improvement in my Blood sugar levels with the Fenugreek treatment alone.  In fact Fenugreek tea seemed to serve as a diuretic.  

I have tried about 4 to 6 oz. of fenugreed seeds by themselves per day starting about 2 Months ago when I needed to lower my high blood pressure and for this one particular purpose, Fenugreek seeds really seem to do the job quickly and effectively.  

I would Highly, Highly reccomend them for the treatment of hypertension, at least in my situation.  I drive Tractor Trailers for a living and I have seen my blood pressure go all of the way up to 166/96 but come all of the way down to a steady 120-128/80-90 after using 5-6 oz. of fenugreek seeds per day.  They are hard to chew though and You have to swallow them, much the same as tablets with liquid.  I am now trying some fenugreek powder, which will dissolve in water very well, just to see what the effect of It really is.  
One problem with the Fenugreek seeds are that they can cause diarrhea.  The other possible side effect that I have noticed is that I think that they may have a tendency to cause depression.   

For my sexual performance, I would give this supplement 5 stars.  It is a natural Viagra or Levitra!

Overall, I have felt much better physically since I have been taking the Fenugreek seeds.
For a 51 Year old man, It has given me back 15 Years in the way that I am feeling everyday. 

Check out Your Indian food store for Fenugreek seed and powder or buy fresh ""Methi"" or clover.  This may be a hard product to juice, without clogging Your juice machine but It will give You a juice a lot like spinach. ","

"My sister had diabetes more than 20 years ,She has been taking metformin, Glimiperide, Actos and recently januvia .However the blood glucose she checks on evry meals still high . Two months ago her blood test result showed that the kidneys has problem ,her Dr, prescibed insulin for her instead of metformin but blood glucose level still high ( after meal usually more than 200 , fasting :140 .A1C level 8.3) 
So she decided to take fenugreek tea before lunch and dinner ( we soak 1/2 tea spoon of fenugreek seeds with 1 cup of hot water for 4 hours then take half of it at luch time ( about 150 ml ) and the rest before dinner . note : have to drink it BEFORE meal about 20 minutes). So far her blood sugar is under control .Fasting :under 100. Before meal :under 130 .After meal 2 hours : 130-150. She just took fenugreek about 2 months ,will have another blood test ( A1C) this month. 
Fenugreek seeds seems very effective in my sister case but if she drinks it every day ( eventhough very very mild fenugreek tea) I'm wondering if it will cause her harm . Please help me some feed back ! greatly appreciate.","

"First, I hate taking pills, and especially prescription meds.I got organic fenugreek seed powder for various reasons...diabetes runs in both my family and my husbands. He is borderline on cholestrol and I've had pain in  my knees due to arthritis & deterioration of the hip joints. Fenugreek has controlled that pain where other pain relievers only helped mildly or briefly. It gives me all kinds of energy, too. My attitude and memory are better. I am post menapausal(by surgery for 20 yrs), and fenugreek contains estrogen. I do not and have not taken prescription estrogen replacement for many years because of side effects- it caused me to get severe leg pains. Fenugreek is also suppose to keep your breast healthy. There is one ""side effect"" though that I am still trying to find the right dosage to control. I want to control my pain, without getting ""overly aroused"". I am absolutely serious about this. It can be almost unbearable at times. If you are single or widowed, it could present a problem. I contacted the company and received an email yesterday, they suggested trying Turmeric and less Fenugreek. I plan to try that. But, I love the extra energy.","

Could it be the Fenugreek which data claims lower the bad and raises the good cholestrol. Who knows.

There is no greater sensitivity or level of sexual enjoyment with its use. It isn't a magic bullet, it simply increases a few important physiological results. After taking this over the counter medication, I had my doctor prescribe actual testosterone, Depo-Testosterone. I'm only a few days into my first injection (its 1ml/mo), but I can notice and elevation in both my energy and mood levels. I went through the standard Low T test battery, and my level was in the normal range, the doctor had done the tests before and didn't see a need to prescribe it then. This time I told her that I would hold her completely harmless for this trial that the choice was mine. I am a 48 year old Caucasian male in very good health. So far, I have noticed an appreciable difference in my mood--my main desire. The first day was profound, I had a hopefulness that I hadn't felt in many years. And no, the placebo effect wasn't in play. I am too honest and analytical to try to fool myself. If anyone has a question, I would not mind at all answering it, ","

I had read online about other breastfeeding moms having success with it, so I did some research and decided that I would give it a try. There are side effects to be aware of as with any herb or drug. Fortunately for me I have not experienced any adverse side effects. Nor has my baby. I have noticed a slight maple syrup odor to my urine. No big deal. I take 2 610mg capsules 3 times a day. I noticed a significant improvement in my milk supply after 2 days of taking fenugreek. I take it with food, as directed. I also noticed a boost in my energy level. That was an added bonus for me as I'm a busy mom of two. I maintain a healthy diet and stay well hydrated. I continue to breastfeed as normal, every 2-3 hours and once or twice overnight. I highly recommend this herb to breastfeeding mamas who need a boost! I love it, it's fantastic! However, just do your homework and make sure it's right for you!  ","

Recently, I got off the Simvastatin on August 12th since I've been taking that for like 5 years straight and need a break.  I was starting to get E.D. symptoms, but they are all gone and sex-drive is back with Fenugreek/flaxseed reducing LDL without Simvastatin which can cause ED, and Niacin to increase HDL.

You should ensure that when taking Omega 3s that the DHA level is quite high (200 or more) and that it is molecularly distilled to remove any toxins/heavy metals - cheaper fish oil capsules that are not molecularly distilled can make your condition worse.  Should be taken with meals to prevent stomach upset (I take one capsule three times a day).,"

I have been suffering with treatment resistant depression for about 6 years. This treatment along with diet modification and added exercise has had an enormous effect in treating my depression symptoms. Also used are vitamin D and SAMe. The depression was improving with the fish oil alone as I was taking it 3 weeks before the other supplements and really kicked in after adding the other supplements. I have also noted other health benefits like most of my knee pain is gone and the swelling from my recent knee replacement has greatly diminished. It could be coincidence but I have not had an asthma attack since using the fish oil.,"

"I started myself on Omega 3, 6, & 9 approx. 3 months ago, almost immediately after being diagnosed with Systemic Lupus. I did this after a thorough research related to all natural lupus remedies and treatments. I am not only a Lupus patient, but i've beed a nurse for 9 years now. I've seen my patients taking medications to try and treat their lupus over these years, and the only way it seems i see the outcome be consistent is the nausea/vomitting, diarrhea,hair loss,weight loss,etc.....
Since seeing these side effects close up and personal, wasn't a hard decision to decide to go the all natural route to treat my lupus. I can honestly say i could see about a 65-75% improvement in the pain and stiffness to bilateral hands  mid knuckles. 
No side effects?? Raises good cholesterol?? Who wouldn't go this route!! :)","

After about a month of treatment I started to have large amounts of blood and blood clots in my urine.The uroligist determined that the fish oil was the cause. The bleeeding was from the enlarged prostate. I am a male 92 years old. A catheter was inserted and blood clots were removed several times to facilitate urination. After 6 days the bleeding has stopped and the amount of fish oil in the blood has decreased. The uroligist says it may take 5 more days to clear the fish oil entirely. ,"

"The short of it: I hate to be a party-pooper.  There's no *perceptible* difference that I can feel, and the very latest research from Yale, where the scientists combed through all the studies, is that the studies just don't show a connection between ingestion of EPA/DHA and relief of bipolar or depressive symptoms.  Michael Bloch's team at Yale found that there was no *meaningful* connection between use of DPA/EHA and these disorders.  (The article: Mol Psychiatry. 2012 Dec;17(12):1272-82. doi: 10.1038/mp.2011.100. Epub 2011 Sep 20.).

Then again, the research does indicate that omega-3s are helpful for cardiac pathology, and certainly they don't *harm* you, so I'm going to keep taking them.  I'm just going to be careful not to spend a fortune on them, and not to ignore other treatment options and put all my eggs in the Omega-3 basket.

"My MD advised I go on 2 grams of fish oil daily about 2 1/2 years for triglyceride control. The first 6 months went fine - no adverse events, but not much effect on the triglycerides. After 6-8 months, I slowly developed irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). I had been on the fish oil for so long, it did not occur to me that it could be the cause. The IBS slowly got worse to the point where I was tested for celiac disease and gluten intolerance - negative on both fronts. The IBS got to the point where I was having up to ten BM's a day - not diarrhea, just constantly in the bathroom. It was miserable -it was hard to go out for even a few hours. It actually caused me to change jobs from a 70% travel position to an inside position. I saw the 2013 NEJM data on the ineffectiveness of fish oil in cardiac conditions, saw my doc and told him I was going to discontinue the fish oil because it wasn't doing anything for the triglycerides and I saw no long term benefit. 4 weeks later ALL my IBS symptoms were gone. I told my doc and he was as shocked as I was - he'd never seen delayed onset IBS with fish oil. So if you have developed IBS in fish oil, talk to your doc and tell him that it can happen. It sucked, I'll never touch that product again as long as I live. ","

"I am a 44 year old female. I have worked out lifting weights for 25 years. I am in great shape. Yet...I have been having all these symptoms. I was advised to take Krill oil for inflammation. I have low blood pressure, chlorestorel is fine. I have been taking iron, 150 mg for over two years. Everytime I stop taking it, my iron levels plummet. If fish oil prevents blood clotting, ie thickening of blood,and can cause bleeding from the liver,, would taking this krill oil be causing me to lose iron? Just wanted to chime in with my theory. I think Ill stop taking it for awhile. The body doesnt need much fat. Hormones are made from chlorestorel. But think of the body as mostly water. What happens when you put oil, in water? It floats. Think of your blood. Basically, the oil is greasing up your blood. I have read studies about vit e and estrogen that state estrogen is inactive until activated by e, e is an oil. when activated by the wrong oil, it can trigger cancer. I even wonder if the body needs ANY external oils at all. This states that the omegas are not naturally made in the body. Then why supplument them? I looked up what oil actually is, and this is really gross, but oil is decaying life, ie human, and animal remains over millions of years. I think Ill work to keep my body as watery as possible. ","

"I have taken over the counter, Source Naturals Ultra Potency, Enteric coated, Omega 3 Fish oil, for approx 3 yrs. to help control high triglycerides.  Recently, my primary physician prescribed Lovaza. It is a more pure form of Omega 3 fish oil. It has worked well, in lowering triglycerides. It has also caused fewer fish burps, even though it is not enteric-coated. However, I have started developing intestinal problems, (bloating, gastritis, diarrhea, upper abdominal pain) after taking the fish oil. 
I always take Omega 3 with a meal, but the symptoms have become so uncomfortable, that I have stopped it. I even tried the over the counter capsules again, and I am getting the same side effects. 
I am sure it is the Fish oil causing stomach distress, after the process of eliminating all other possible causes. I may give myself a rest for a few weeks and try again, but intestinal problems are some of the side effects listed for all Omega 3 fish oils.

Brand name either Nature Made or Kirkland (not seen in drop-down menu).  Not sure if it is really effective against hypertension.  If did not take blood pressure pill (Amlodipine) on the same day for a few days, bld pres might (not always) increase, even fish oil was taken on those days.  Have recently suspended taking fish oil due to a July 2013 National Cancer Institute publication that fish oil supplement (Omega 3) can lead to prostate cancer.  Shall consult with doctor in next appointment.  Am surprised that WebMD does not mention and discuss this latest important finding to warn male readers.  A medical doctor on eHealth Forum reported he cut down fish oil supplement himself after reading the NCI article.  Also, I saw scientific articles that fish oil can lower platelet counts.  Did not see this info on WebMD--whether the finding is creditable or not.  Would like to see a response and discussion from WebMD.

"There isn't a category for anxiety, agitation, or mood swings, so I had to put my review under bipolar disorder.

I take 2000 mg of omega 3s in fish oil daily with fluoxetine (Prozac) and it makes a HUGE difference.  I drive much slower, I'm much more patient, and people don't aggravate me half as much.

Fish oil works by reducing inflammation in the brain on a sub-cellular level which allows the neurotransmitters in the brain to be able function more efficiently without misfiring (which is believed to be the cause of many mood disorders).

Regardless if you're suffering general anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, or any number off issues, fish oil will only help.

Be sure to read the label, just because it says 1000 mg on the bottle means very little.  What is important are how many mg of actual omega 3s are in each capsule.  Most drug store brands have about 300mg of omega 3s and to be effective for mood disorders, you need 2000-3000 mgs of omega 3s daily.  Specifically EPA.

I was restricted from treatment after, due to breastfeeding until she was six months old.  I went on clobetasol shortly after and it only helped slightly.  I was still peeling off patches of skin at a time.  I went to the specialist and they wanted to put me on Humira.  I wanted anything to help me.  I was depressed, just anything would help.  Then I received a letter from my insurance company that denied me that prescription.  I tried other avenues. I tried fish oil.  It has changed so much.  I do not have the flaky skin anymore.  My hands, elbows and legs have transformed in the short two weeks of using fish oil. It has helped me so much.  Don't get me wrong.  This has helped.   I still have a few psoriasis patches yet.

"Even after researching the likely effectiveness, I postponed trying Fish Oil for treating joint pain and depression until the day that I awoke with ALL JOINTS aching including a rather sudden limited mobility... Could be the placebo effect or some other contributing factor but I perceived SIGNIFICANT reduction in pain and COMPLETE mobility restored within the first 2-3 days! Simultaneously, my depressed mood improved very significantly. Chicken or the egg?  Both joint pain/mobility AND MOOD improved so significantly AND SO QUICKLY that I believe that the two were not significantly interrelated. Because dosage can be so confusing, I am providing the brand name, etc. I took ""Nature Made Fish Oil 1200 mg"", 360 mg Omega-3 twice daily. 

The breakdown from the label: Fish Oil Concentrate 2400 mg/total omega-3 fatty acids 720 mg (Omega-3 EPA 360 mg/Omega-3 DHA 240 mg/Other omega-3 120 mg). Again, I have been taking 2 softgels daily.

However, after reading reviews/ratings here, I may consider increasing this dosage from 2 to 3 softgels daily.  Thanks so much to all contributors!  This is an awesome resource for information!  Scientific studies necessarily lag behind first-hand experiences...

my treatment isn't really any of your business what is important is that the info i was looking for you don't provide  that is which forms are natural and which if any are man made (and therefore suspect to being bad or ineffective). there was no way provided for a curious user to ask questions
no way to expand knowledge beyond a dictionary definition. you should be more than that.

My thyroid put my metabolism to sleep, in spite of my cardio and strength training 4 to 5 times a week, it takes forever for the weight to come off still.  I am on thyroid medicine and my TSH #'s are monitored on a regular basis.
  BUT THIS IS THE SHOCKER!!!!  I have learned that Folic Acid feeds cancer cells and helps the cancer to grow.  Now they have found a way to use this to help in surgery.  It is important for the surgeon to get all the malignant cancer cells during surgery.  So they mix a bright glowing dye with the folic acid and give it to the patient.  When the body processes the nutrient it goes straight to the cancer cells and the doctors can recognize the malignant tissue that they want to cut out because the cancer cells light up from the glowing dye in the folic acid.  The healthy tissue around the cancer is not affected because the cancer cells feed off of the folic acid to grow. The folic acid is drawn to the cancer like a magnet as it feeds on the nutrient to grow.  IS THIS TRUE??????  Why oh why aren't we notified of the dangers with some of the vitamins out there?

There is a large difference between L-Methylfolate and Folic Acid.  Folic acid is Synthetic and has to go through a 4 step process to be used by the body where as L-Methylfolate is already in the form used by the body.  Those with the MTHFR mutations will have a difficulty processing the synthetic folic acid into the usable form.  It's incorrect of this site to state that they are the same thing because they are quite different as my own health story proves.,"

Folic Acid and 5-MTHF or (L-Methylfolate) are different substances.  I wish Web MD would not lump them together.  Folic Acid is synthetic and it likely feeds cancer cells.  Folate occurs naturally in foods.  See this blog for the explanation. http://blog.designsforhealth.com/blog/bid/115121/ Folic-Acid-vs-Folate-Part-I

I hope WEB MD clears this up.  WEB MD is a great site with only occasional  misinformation.  So WEB MD, thanks for the site.

I use Metabolic Maintenance brand, 5-MTHF, or Methylfolate, 10 mg.  This is a generic version of the medical food Deplin.  Read the reviews for Deplin on Web MD. 

 I have just started using it so I can't tell if it is working.   I just wanted to clear up the misinformation of folic acid versus folate (l-methylfolate, 5-MTHF).","

My head definitely feels much improved. My energy level also has improved. However, I blame this supplement on huge amount of weight gain (10 lbs) in seven (7) weeks.

"I think to call folic acid 'folate' as if they are the same thing is hugely misleading and dangerous to suggest they are the same thing. Folic Acid, which is a much cheaper supplement than folate should be converted to folate by the body, but for those of us with a genetic MTHFR mutation (30-50% of the population!), taking folic acid is dangerous because we cannot convert it. Real folate is necessary in dealing with an MTHFR mutation and the long list of symptoms that stem from it: depression, fatigue, diabetes, cancers, chronic pain, etc.

"This doesn't give a reason of miscarriage or MTHFR as reasons for taking this treatment, but it's the real reason I did.  I had 6 miscarriages, 5 of which were consecutive after having had 3 healthy children.  I went to doctor after doctor finally being diagnosed with MTHFR.  After an RE recommended folic acid (which is NOT the same as methylfolate - 2 different forms of vitamin B9), I discovered that made things worse.  I did my own research and discovered methylfolate.  I took this and the very next pregnancy was carried to full term with a healthy baby as a result.  Not only that though - my chronic fatigue, depression, neurological issues, and memory loss all immediately and dramatically improved.

Folic acid is synthetic and cheap - but it is not what the body uses.  It has to convert it to methylfolate first.  For those of us with MTHFR polymorphisms, this process is either partially or completely broken.  Folic acid is not only useless to us, it is actually deadly.  I wish someone had told me years ago all I needed was a better vitamin B9!!","

"I began using GABA due to weird migraine symptoms, as if I was going into brain seizures lasting 5 - 20 minutes; job stress; anxiety and the inability to concentrate on one thing at a time. I am a heart patient, I had heart surgery in 2007 to repair an aneurysm due to a congenital defect called BAV. It took me 2 weeks to get used to the feeling on GABA, but it helped me sleep better, anxiety was reduced greatly, and the weird migraines disappeared. I would like to wean off of GABA because I have been taking them nightly for about 3 years.  I have nothing bad to say about GABA. My experience with GABA has been great. I have recommended it to many! However, I believe it is time to stop taking them. My health has improved due to my heart condition, and my life is more in balance. Has anyone out there ever tried to wean off of GABA after several years of use?  Please let me know.  Thank you. Lilly","

"I have been taking GABA at 1000 mg I have chronic pain, anxiety, depression and sleep issues due to a condition called fibromyalgia. I see no huge differences with my sleep. But before I woke up everyday in pain and now I don't. Depression is well managed and I am not having any anxiety. I don't have an over medicated calm just a clear mind more myself calm. I also lost 30lbs. I workout 3x per week 1hr 30min, but I had way better results. My body fat has greatly reduced. I had Fibro, Crohn's disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, IBS and other health issues when starting GABA. I'm off blood pressure meds and have seen no bad side effects from taking GABA.","

"I have Dystonia, spadmodic torticulosis, and after being on muscle relaxers for 5 years I started looking for a natural alternative so that I could get off the prescription muscle relaxers. I had to learn not to take too much GABA because it does relax all your muscles including your breathing which can be very disconcerting. It has replaced the prescription meds and truly helps the spasms ease off. The other day the Dystonia flared up and I couldn't turn my neck to the left because the muscles had tightened so hard on the right.  I took a strong dose of GABA and within an hour I could feel the muscles start to loosen up and I took another dose a couple of hours later and then could start to turn my head to the left again. I have been taking GABA since 2007, 6 years, and I can go without taking it when the Dystonia isn't acting up and suffer no withdrawal effects.  You need to learn how to take it so that you find your theraputic dose without impacting your breathing or the tingling in your face.  If you feel those effects you have taken too much. I've also noticed that if I take a dose on an empty stomach you will feel the effects of the GABA more quickly and stronger.  If you've eaten you may need to take a little more GABA to get the muscle relaxing affect.  My doctor is fully aware of what I take and how much and fully supports this alternative to prescription muscle relaxers.","

I started taking Gaba for anxiety attacks and have been taking it both in the morning and evening for two months now. Amazingly it has worked great for the anxiety attacks but in the last few weeks I have felt unbelievably tired and exhausted all day. I think the problem is that I was taking 2 capsules in the morning and 1-2 at night. I couldn't understand why I felt so tired and exhausted all day as I hadn't changed anything else in my diet or routine so I researched the net and found out that tiredness is a side effect of Gaba. I will now start taking one capsule only at bedtime and see how that works. Hope my input here helps others. I will wait a few months to see how reducing the Gaba works and get back to this site.     ,"

Though I had no withdrawal symptoms after having taken Klonopin for over two years ( I was really lucky. 50% of the population has no physical withdrawal after prolonged use.  Apparently I'm in that 50%) I still had anxiety issues.  I had forgotten that GABA is a neurotransmitter that blocks over excitation, so I tried it sublingually ( I know that the molecule is digested if taken orally).  I expected nothing, but the anti anxiety effects were noticeable after after just 500 mg.  I highly recommend it it.","

"I've used GABA to help with general anxiety, and as a sleep aid.

I purchase pure GABA in bulk online, with no other ingredients. I dissolve the powder in water and take it by mouth an hour before bed. 

Subjectively, I feel very relaxed. There is pain relief in my lower back. I find it very easy to fall asleep, within 15 minutes, as most nights I toss/turn for about 30 minutes to an hour.

I am less anxious during the day. I'm not sure if this is because I've been sleeping better, or because of the GABA itself.

Some side effects I experience are shortness of breath and an itching sensation similar to when I take Niacin. Both of these subside within 10 to 20 minutes.

With better sleep and a general state of calm throughout my day, I would recommend GABA.

I've heard some skeptical people claim that GABA does not work because it cannot cross the BBB (Blood Brain Barrier). I cannot overlook my experience and results for their theories, and neither should you.

"I had waken up one day feeling itchy on my vulvar area. I know it was just a yeast infection because I have had it before when I was pregnant so I tried to ignore it for at least six or seven months until one day it got so bad, I couldn't ignore it anymore. I know I need to do something but I hate to go see the doctor because I don't want to take any antibiotic as I am a believer on natural remedies. So I decided to search online for cures on yeast infections until I come across this blog that shares the same problem as I have. They mentioned the topical effectiveness of fresh garlic but I decided to use the Garlic oil High Concentrate Extract capsule 1000mg. I broke 2 capsules and apply it topically after washing twice a day and orally take one capsule twice a day. I gradually fell better and experienced total relief from itching after around 2 to 3 days but I had also noticed that I felt more energized and more alert than usual. I felt so good overall that I decided to continue taking at least one capsule before bedtime. I also used to have a borderline blood pressure like between 120 to 130 systolic and 80 to 90 diastolic. Recently, my blood pressure is just within normal range. I plan to continue taking the garlic capsule as it seems to have a wholistic effect on me.","

"Crush fresh garlic. Apply the garlic to a bandaid. Protect healthy skin around the wart from being burnt by the garlic with either Vaseline or a piece of medical tape with a hole cut out for the wart to stick through, then apply the bandaid over the wart. Leave this on for up to 12 hours (overnight may prove to be long enough).  If you're first layer of tape is absorbent from the outside in to the skin, you can cover it with another piece of regular tape that will block the garlic juice from getting through the medical tape to protect healthy skin, just don't forget to punch a hole in that layer too before applying the bandaid.  The reason you want medical tape as first layer against skin is that it won't injure skin, which can't be guaranteed with a regular plastic tape, not knowing what chemicals were used on the sticky side.   After wearing the garlic bandaid for prescribed time, let the wart heal up for several days. If it shows any signs of coming back reapply the crushed garlic.  If not, enjoy you're new cleared up skin. ","

"I have used garlic for warts and moles. The moles scratch off and warts shrink. Sister had planters wart and it worked with that also.  I have told many people who tried it and all have had great success. You can use the pills and it works the same as the garlic bulb. The moles take a few weeks if you take one pill a day to flake off. Warts take up to a few months depending on how big they are and how often you take it. I took only one tablet per week and it took me a few months for one wart. It will leave the skin with a slightly dark mark and you can feel the change that happened to the skin but there is no bump. Take it in the morning so you do not get heart burn. If you take it at night you will have acid re-flux, at least I do. Most of the people I know who used it at night had problems with heart burn. If you stop taking it for a few months some moles tend to come back but when you use it again they flake off again. The warts so not seem to grow if you stop and will continue to shrink if you start back up again. Works better then burning them off.     ","

They gave me more antibiotic, it wasn't getting worse but it wasn't getting better. I went to the hospital again the doctors were concerned and I was supposed to go back in a few days if there wasn't improvement. I got home and read a London(England) medical journal regarding the effectiveness of garlic against MRSA. I was so tired of the MRSA wounds I was willing to try anything. I started eating 1-2 cloves of raw garlic per day (plus my antibiotics) within 3 days the MRSA infection appeared to be healing! Thank god for garlic!

"Reading that Nature Made garlic tablets were cold-processed to keep the compounds active until ingestion gave me confidence. Like raw garlic, if caught in the first 2 or 3 hours of symptoms, either completely got rid of cold symptoms by next day or 48 hours. Dosage: 2 tablets every 2 hours. If it was areally strong bug, or I waited too long, would still get the 5-day cold.  A badder cold bug gave me two weeks of symptoms,  but usually no fever.  Symptoms peaked at days 3-5 and then improved rapidly.  I usually get bronchitis,  so I get garlic tablets to carry so I can start as soon as a sore throat/coughing starts.  I have not noticed such a good results with other presumably heat-processed garlic tablets. 
My first experience with garlic was biting into a clove of elephant garlic at the height of a sore throat, and having the side of my throat which contacted garlic juice stop being sore.","

I also am finding that it is helping me to breathe easier (as I have asthma also).  Coincidence?  Don't think so.  Just my 2 cents.  I take the garlic food, not the pill supplements.  Maybe the ingredient allicin in the garlic helps this?  I was informed by a pharmacist that unscented garlic is not as effective, so that is what brought me directly to the food aisle instead.

"I wish I had never taken raw garlic. I only ate raw garlic on one single occasion, but regret ever taking it. I took it because I had had a tiny bit of diarrhoea the week before and then I thought I was constipated, and read online that raw garlic is good for digestion. I cut up a clove of garlic into tiny pieces and ate them with buttered toast. I experienced severe burning in my throat and stomach, and had bad diarrhoea for a couple of days. My digestive system felt really burned and irritated for several days. This was almost 2 months ago and ever since my digestive system has been a bit messed up. I've started getting heartburn attacks and constant acid reflux (constant feeling of needing to burp, acid coming up my throat when I do burp, feeling of lump in my throat). I can't say for sure if it was the raw garlic, but it really did not suit my digestive system. My digestive system may have been a bit off anyway and the raw garlic acted as a catalyst in making it worse. But I found a research article online that showed ingestion of raw garlic causes stomach ulcers in dogs 100% of the time! And in humans there have been cases of it causing stomach ulcers and bleeding. I would never have taken the raw garlic if I knew it could do that. I wish I'd read some proper warnings before consuming the garlic rather than all this stuff saying it could only do good. I'm just hoping my digestive system goes back to normal soon...","

"I took an antibiotic for enlarged prostrate for over a month. Symptoms improved, but not eliminated. After finishing the Rx, symptoms began to increase. I started using 4000mg of garlic with a B complex vitamin (B3 has been discovered to improve the effectiveness of antibiotics). This helped me maintain minimal symptoms for several months. I stopped taking garlic and symptoms increased. I just restarted taking garlic 2 days ago and symptoms are much improved. 
It doesn't appear to be a cure, but definitely has been useful to manage symptoms.

"What most need to understand is that insulin obviously plays a huge role in diabetes (hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia).  My insulin, for some reason is unstable.  I was having ""insulin shock"" and it was getting pretty bad.  Originally, I went out and got some garlic to regulate my circulation and trying to ward off colds.  It didn't take long that I discovered that I was waking up without any insulin disturbances.  I'm not a rocket scientist, but garlic did something to restore my insulin balance.  Can't knock it.  I also am finding that it is helping me to breathe easier (as I have asthma also).  Coincidence?  Don't think so.  Just my 2 cents.  I take the garlic food, not the pill supplements.  Maybe the ingredient allicin in the garlic helps this?  I was informed by a pharmacist that unscented garlic is not as effective, so that is what brought me directly to the food aisle instead.  Glad I did.","

More than that I started to smell like garlic so I had to cut back. I also changed a number of other things so I can’t swear it was just the garlic that did it but 3 months later my cholesterol was down 45 points.  No meds! 

I made the mistake of eating a raw freshly peeled clove once and my body didn’t hesitate to send it back the way it came. Never, ever will eat it raw like that again. Fermented is still raw but makes it sweeter, tasty, and takes the sharp edge off. ","

I took natural remedies like green tea, turmeric, cayenne powder in capsules (self made), calcium, Vit. K2, Vit. D3, Omega 3 Fish Oil,  garlic (raw or capsules), magnesium etc. After taking the ginger tea for about a month, I went for a blood and cardiac screening last week and the result was:

"I have been diagnosed with acid reflux, it can get so bad it makes it hard to breath at one point I used to throw up every other meal and was almost dreading eating because it was so hard to keep things down. I did not have this issue until I took abilify, a horrible drug peddled to anyone with anything that ever went wrong in their mind, so i was then put on omeprazole, taking tums and what not to try and manage the hell it was giving me. One day, my mother made this really interesting bone marrow broth, delicious, especially with black pepper and ginger bits, to add substantial flavor. My father has the same issue, he called it an elixir for his stomach, I tried it, and suddenly my stomach felt amazing, nothing at all was trying to come up I felt sane and I ate a ton of food and could keep eating without losing control of my gut. I haven’t taken any medicine for my stomach in years, and ginger doesn’t even have to be a daily thing for me. Maybe it won’t work for everyone, as everybody is different, maybe it was something specific and awful that abilify did to me that ginger could simply fix, but I feel like it’s a plant that actually cures thinfs rather than mask symptoms of a bigger problem. All in all, any time my stomach acts up, I spend maybe 50 cents at walmart and my sanity and sleep and appetite is restored. I definitely sill have my condition, but I notice it improve with ginger. My appetite is terrible, practically addicted to soda and restaurants, so that’s a giant part of it, but ginger seems to keep me alive and I do take fish oil and vitamins to manage the general lack if nutrients I’m getting, too poor and busy to be healthy. But anyway, I recommend ginger, everyone’s case is different, but you can save yourself a lot of money and side effects if it sorts out your problems.","

"There are a few herbs that deserve much closer scrutiny. My experience has been first hand. Herbs dosages are critically important for some herbs. Ginkgo like yohimbe and ginseng is very concentrated and has powerful effects most commonly than not. We are far too reckless with these. I wouldn't experiment with Ginkgo unless a last resort is very necessary. Its your brain after all. Use a detox instead for your brain. Adrenals and hormone levels have been my first concern for aging fatigue, hair loss and male sexual function. For me Ginkgo is no good at all and difficult to be free of the side effects. Worse than chromium picolinate and may last years longer.

"I started taking one ginkgo pill a day during weekdays. I noticed being clearer in the head. Unfortunately, when I skip the weekend days I get a headache that doesn't go away, similar to a caffeine withdrawal headache. After reading some reviews, I see that it is likely due to the impact that the ginkgo has on relieving headaches. The withdrawal headaches scare me. I also think that it may be impacting my sleep as I used to sleep perfectly, but on the ginkgo, I find myself waking at around 3am and then restless after that. Very odd. I like the increased blood flow to the brain idea, but am concerned with these other effects.","

"I've been taking Gingko Biloba (and several other supplements) for about two months. Here are some symptoms I no longer have: tinnitus, high blood pressure, chronic fatigue.

One thing I *suspect* GB has done is to reduce the severity of a poison ivy rash. I get it late EVERY winter, and this year was no different...except in the severity. I still have the rash and redness all over my arms and some on my legs. However, there are no oozing, weeping blisters.

Last year, it was so bad that it went deeper than the skin and ate into my flesh in one spot...leaving a scar that's still there today. This year, it itches very little, the rash isn't very raised, and as I said, absolutely no blisters.

I'm wondering, because the GB plant can cause an allergic skin reaction, much like poison ivy...is it possible that ingesting the supplement has helped my body counteract the effects of poison ivy?","

"Heed the warnings regarding interactions!  I was using Gingko for three weeks to improve my memory.  My Rhuematologist prescribed Ibuprofen twice daily for my arthritis and did not ask if I was taking anything.  Two weeks later, a massive bruise suddenly appeared on my wrist.  It was four inches across and travelled half way up my inner arm. It was hot to the touch and quite swollen. I had not injured myself and had no idea why this was happening, so looked online to see if I could self-diagnose and found the contraindications of taking the two medications together.  Thank goodness the bleeding was on my arm and not internal.  I stopped taking the Gingko right away.  Please investigate. I wish the doctor had asked, because I had no idea.","

Was asked to try this by friends who have been using it. I would rather continue eating healthy real food and exercising. A quick fix is just that...a quick fix. The only way to get weight off and keep it off is to change your eating habit by making a lifestyle change. Do you have any idea just what this medication does long term? 2 yrs? 5 yrs? ten yrs down the road? My way may take longer but it is so much healthier...and maintainable! ,"

"I have been using a Product Called Skinny Fiber who's main ingredient is Glucomannan, before using the product I was always hungry..therefore I overate, and with overeating comes extra pounds, I had always been a member of the ""Clean Plate"" club but no more I am now able to push my plate away once full..I am also getting much more exercise by walking away from the fridge.. I am loving my Skinny Fiber. Also since taking it I have noticed an unexpected side effect. My fingernails, eyelashes, and hair are growing much more rapidly and are stronger than ever. Not sure if it is the glucomannan  Cha De bugre or Caralluma (other herbs in product) I am losing weight and feeling GREAT.  I am so happy that I found this lifechanging product.

"Glutathione can be converted into toxic thiols by some people. The sulphur in it can be converted to toxins by some gut bacteria. It can break down into its component parts and releases free glutamate. When the body has excess nitric oxide it converts to peroxynitrite and this reacts with glutathione to make s-nitrosglutathione (a molecule involved in inflammation and vasodilatation). Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) is a glycoprotein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutathione to glutamate - and thus sufferers of neurological diseases like migraines and ALS are just as likely, because of all the factors wrong in their bodies, to break glutathione down into it's components, releasing glutamate (excitotoxin).  when the liver has been damaged (as from heavy metals or acetaminophen) and cause the liver's ""hepatocytes"" to release the enzyme GGT. 
Leukotriene C4 synthase is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the LTC4S gene.[1][2]
The protein encoded by this gene, LTC4S (or glutathione S-transferase II) is an enzyme that converts leukotriene A4 and glutathione to create leukotriene C4.  .. there is more if you search..

"I began receiving IV treatments from my doctor as part of a weight loss and health routine. I should also note that I have changed my diet and exercise plan. I lost a substantial amount of weight the first 30 days - 28 lbs to be exact. Month three of my treatment I became very ill, flu like symptoms,I almost though I had food poising. It last three days. Two weeks later I became ill again, same symptoms. I called my Doctor and asked if it was possible for the Glutathione IV to give me this reaction, he said; "" Glutathione can cause a loss of Zinc, you should take Zinc"". I took zinc lozenges an after 12 hours feel better. I don't know if anyone else has experienced this. I do know that I am normally very healthy and do not not get the cold or flu. The only change I have made is taking the Glutathione treatments.

Naturally after a hard work I experience pain, especially if I eat acidic foods. Sometimes I can experience pain for up to three days after a hard workout. When I take L-Glutathione tablets combined with a very tight diet the pain caused by a hard workout subsides in about 30 minutes. When I don't want to feel a lot of pain from anything, I move toward eating a vegetarian diet. I move in and out of different types of diets depending on what my goals are at any given time.

I have only been using this supplement for a couple weeks, so in fairness, I should give it more time. At this point, I have not noticed any 'drastic' results. Perhaps, because glucathione is found naturally in the liver, the effects will be subtle, yet beneficial over time. I am going to continue to take this supplement since it is a natural substance needed for the body and as our age declines, so does our livers ability to produce this substance. Since glucathione is a substance that clears heavy metals and free radicals from the body, it must be important. I will continue the glucathione patches and oral capsules. ","

"I was diagnosed with Chronic Venous Insufficiency the flares were horrific. I would experience SEVERE pain 24/7 from the knee below in one leg. The flare ups thankfully only happen on one leg at a time otherwise my ability to walk would be extremely affected. when I am in a flare I cannot put any weight on that leg it swells from the knee down and is red, inflamed and tender like cellulitis also the skin around my ankles & lower legs became discolored almost black. For Two yrs I dealt with this chronic pain & using a cane to walk and on constant pain medication & still no one could tell me what the problem was until recently. A vascular surgeon has suggested closing the greater saphenous veins in both legs to help solve the problem. A coworker saw an episode of Dr. Oz mentioning varicose veins at which point they mentioned Gotu Kola. No kidding the first day I took it I could walk without my cane and the pain was beginning to decrease. I am taking 425mg capsules once a day sometimes 2 times a day. I've been on it for 5 days now and I am almost walking completely normal without any limp and no pain medication! Truly this stuff is amazing! Hopefully my skin will begin to clear up and I can refrain from wearing compression stockings on a daily basis. Until then I'm going to keep taking it and see what happens!","

"I didn't really think of myself this way, but I've been sedentary for several years, working long hours at a desk job and tending to be a couch potato at night and on weekends. ""I can't do one more thing"" was my inner mantra. I started taking gotu kola tea a month ago, putting a small teaspoonful of the powdered form into a cup of boiling water. After a few days the first signs appeared: I decided to take up an old hobby, silk screening t-shirts. The next weekend I  replaced the old floorboards on my front porch and started building a fence around the yard. After a 60-hour work week I didn't think I had time for anything, but now I realize that it was a lack of enthusiasm. For me gotu kola doesn't act like an ordinary stimulant -- rather, the cognitive benefit manifests as enthusiasm which translates to physical energy. ","

"I have chronic general and performance anxiety, which was effecting my social  and professional life to a large extent. I have not taken any prescription medicines knowing well the side effects, except for occasional use of beta blockers during social events and official presentations. I have tried homoeopathy and other alternate medicines to no effect whatsoever. I took Holy Basil not for the intention to reduce my anxiety but for a digestive problem I had, but this had a interesting side effect. Holy Basil worked like a miracle in reduced my social and performance anxiety. I think it works in multiple way, by supporting the adrenal, respiratory and digestive systems, which are the basis things which gets compromised during stress and anxiety.Now I have started using Holy Basil every day. Overall it has changed my life and it is like I am reborn again. The best part is you can take this as a herbal tea and have it as many times as you want, through out the day without any side effects. ","

Sick with pneumonia ...double course of antibiotics ...I was still sick ...I did my own research and saw that Holy Basil helps with fever reduction and loosening of mucus and releives congestion in chest and Lung ...I used it for 2 weeks so far and it is like a miracle ! I first made the tea as a fever reducer from the dried leaves ...2 cups water and 1 teaspoon dried leaves and boiled it down 10 minutes(reduced) to 1 cup of tea and strained it and sipped it hot out of the cup ...WOW! I felt immediately at ease ...body calm but mind clear very interesting ... ....then I went into a sweat that releived my fever .... Now each day I made a light brew of tulsi tea using 1 cup of water and 1 teaspoon of dried leaves ..light boil for 5 minutes and strain then drink hot once in the morning and once in the evening ....I feel better than I have felt in YEARS! I have asthma and this is definately allowing me to breathe easy and deep and clearing the daily mucus out completely .....I have been on every kind of manmade drug for years trying to get releif from the asthma ... this is a miracle if you ask me!  ,"

"I have suffered from chronic bronchitis every spring, triggered by allergy, for several years and getting worse each year.  Since February (I live in South California) I was severely congested in the chest and it was very difficult to cough our the thick mucus.  Mucinex helped to dilute the mucus but it upset my stomach.  I was also using Flonaise and Symbicort everyday since February.  I was also almost constantly taking Halls cough drops.  Coughing and congestion also kept me from sleeping at night. All the medication also made my mouth very dry. 

I got on the internet to find anything that might help and decided to get holy basil capsules (by Himalaya), astragalus capsules, snd Yin-chiao Immune Drops.  I got all three on April 11th and started taking them right away.  I felt much better with my congestion after only two days.  Mucus came out easily.  I immediately totally stopped using all the other medication.   

It's been six days from when I started with Holy Basil, Astragalus, and Yin-chiao, and I have been feeling wonderful.  I still have allergy but no heavy chest congestion or severe coughing.  I also sleep well.  I don't know which of the three herbs is more effective for my bronchitis, but I will continue to take all three.   I have not suffered any side effects either, no upset stomach and my dry mouth is improving.","

I was introduced to Holy Basil by my acupuncturist. She recommended it for my depression. I was skeptical as I had tried other herbs before without much success. Two weeks later I was feeling much better. I ran out for 4 days and my mood plummeted. I was once again sobbing in the shower and pulling screaming mimi's. Three days back on and I felt much better again. It is as effective for me as any antidepressant I have tried. I will simply make sure to never run out agin!,"

"MY asthma and allergies have been getting the better of me lately after a long hiatus. I live in the Central Valley of CA. Got some Holy Basil pills from the Indian market and after about five days of taking the directed dose had a reaction! I don't know if it was fillers in the pills or the Holy Basil itself, but sometimes people who have a lot of allergies should be cautious when taking something new. I'm happy to have tried it and to know that others benefit, but I did not. I will try something else that is herbal in nature though, since allopathic medications can cause intolerance reactions too.

"I have been taking daily inhaled corticosteroids for asthma for over 20 years. Holy Basil is the first herb I have come across that helps reduce the sensation of tightness or heaviness in the chest caused by asthma, without the stimulant effect typical of asthma medications (Holy Basil works similarly to Mucinex.)

Holy Basil also reduces stress, which can help promote sleep without feeling groggy or doped up. In fact, I find Holy Basil most useful against AM insomnia (waking too early with inability to get back to sleep). 

I began taking Holy Basil, initially, as an alternative to NSAIDS because it seems to help relieve muscular pain to some extent.

I find Holy Basil works best in standardized capsule form on an empty stomach. When taking more than one capsule per day, it is possible to become hypoglycemic (for those who are prone, like me, to reactive hypoglycemia).

My most surprising experience with Holy Basil came recently when I ate something that disagreed with me at dinner. The rest of the evening and the night that followed I experienced lower abdominal cramps. In the morning I awoke to my usual AM insomnia and took a Holy Basil capsule to get back to sleep. The intestinal cramps were gone within 40 minutes, and did not return.","

"I take Horny Goat Weed because one of its effects as an anti-inflammatory helping to reduce joint pain, swelling and stiffness (I have a badly inflamed Achilles tendon). It works amazingly well - I take a regular retail capsule which contains 25mg icariin once per day or every two days. I also notice a drop in blood pressure and a slightly faster heart beat and also I get more erections (which is what it is usually taken for). I have been taking it for around 3 months without noticeable side effects although I do notice a slight increase in 'go for it' aggression.","

He referenced how it is used by athletes and actually injected into joints to cure inflammation and discomfort in knees. He said in addition to being proven, it also worked considerable more quickly than a more popular chrondroitin and glucosamine (sic) supplement -- which he was not convinced worked citing some marginal benefits and only after 6-12 months of the latter.

I stumbled across HA because it was an ingredient in a different compound and noticed that my skin became very smooth and without bumps whenever I would take it.  I pinpointed the HA in the compound as the effective ingredient and now take only 20 mg a day or every other day to keep this odd problem under control.  when I stop taking it (being tired of a pill) after a while I notice the problem returning, but corrects again a few days after I restart HA.  I am middle aged now but considering the problem I have, I wonder if it would have been helpful during my acne-ridden teen and young adult years as well, being able to keep the pores open and not clogged.

"I used microbially derived hyaluronic acid, 20 mg., 2 days in a row to try to improve the condition of the vitreous in my eyes.  I was seeing a lot of dark spots in my visual field that were always in the same locations in my visual field.  A retinal specialist said that with age the vitreous of the eye, which is made mostly of hyaluronic acid, can shrink and that causes the symptoms I experience.  So I hoped oral hyaluronic acid supplementation might help.  The first day I took a capsule w/o event.  The second day, w/i one hour of swallowing the capsule, all the knuckles in both hands were painful on use, and my hands felt slightly inflamed in general.  I had never had a single arthritic twinge in my life before that day.  Since then (it's been about 2 weeks), the joints in my hands have been sensitive & slightly painful to use.  I'm very concerned that the oral hyaluronic acid triggered an auto-immune response in me, and that I may experience other negative effects of this auto-immunity including worsening of my eye condition, accelerated skin aging, and further joint issues.","

My pharmacist said this is a new product, I believe the only HA supplement that comes in a lozenge form that dissolves slowly in your mouth (once per day). The company name on the bottle is Complementary prescriptions. Code #CP1125.  I truly hope this will help others, because my heart goes out to anyone with this type of suffering.","

"I am an 83-year-old female, with advanced wet macular degeneration.  I have been treated monthly for five years with intraocular injections of Leucentis to keep the disease at bay.  

Six months ago I began taking hyaluronic acid (50mg/2x/day), for pain relief in my painful osteoarthritic knees.  I got no knee pain relief, but,to my amazement, the following month there was no retinal fluid accumulation,and I required no Leucentis shot.  This had never happened before in the course of my disease (five years).  

It has now been six months since my last Leucentis shot!  Six months without any retinal fluid accumulation!!  It is difficult not to infer a relationship between my oral hyaluronic acid supplementation and this astonishing outcome.

I would encourage any sufferer from wet macular degeneration to give hyaluronic acid a try!!

"A recalled lt hip arthroplasty.  Stryker Ceramic-on-Ceramic.  Developed horrific sqeaking and grinding.  Hospital would not let my Orthopod inject the 2 pt. Hyaluronan into the arthroplasty.  I ordered 3 products ranging in Dalton Wts of 1500-300  1 mil. right up to 2.4 mil.  I am 17 mos. now without squeaking or grinding.  No more heat felt.  No more pain, with an added bonus of my being able to raise both arms over my head again.  Health Care worker with many mini  traumas that = sever osteoarthritis everywhere.
I can not say enough about HA.  We are like our cars. My joints were no longer lubercated the way God designed them to be.  Post Op did not initiat that process.  I do not know if the oral HA is getting to the joints, or assisting my own body to produce the lubercation.  Millions world wide have issues, not the least metalosis.  It is such a simple solution and worth trying if we can get insurance to help with cost and get the FDA out of the way except to make sure the labels are correct on all HA or Hyaloronan products.
Very happy to have known what HA was and found on the Web great info.

Not only do I use it on my face but my neck and upper chest and shoulders area. Sometimes when I go to the store for alcohol,(my guests), I've been asked for my I.D.!!!:)
Not only am I looking better, but it makes me feel younger. I strongly recommend this product and not for just older people,but start using it at a younger age, maybe late 30's to early 40's. Also, you must give it anywhere from 8 to 10 weeks. You Ishtar even notice some changes right away, but continue use. You will be seriously a believer.

"I started taking HA after I had a meniscus tear repaired. My doctor suggested it along with shots in my knee. I developed a bakers cyst in the knee with the meniscus tear and have been taking HA for almost a year now. I still have some pain from the bakers cyst, and I'm now having pain in my other knee and specifically in the meniscus, behind the knee area.  Now, I'm wondering if this really works??? I'm slightly over-weight. Should lose 15 to 20 pounds, but I walk about a mile every day weather permits. Am I wasting my $$ taking HA?","

"My OCD and it's symptoms have been troubling me since the age of 11, nearly 25 years. The symptoms have varied over time as I have gotten older and went from the actions and tics to a manifestation of problematic thoughts with a few lingering tics. This has been troubling to myself and my family, to the point of no end.  We were at our wits end and explored the conventional treatment, of course I don't feel the benefits out weigh the side-effects of those drugs and decided to stick to my more natural path as I do with all my remedies. I tried Inositol as a last resort and said my prayers. My prayers were answered to say the least. I experimented with the dosage, but ultimately decided that 6mg in 2mg doses, three times daily worked best for me. It honestly began working the very first day.  My thoughts were calmer, more regulated and controllable. It allowed me to stop the train that was rolling around in my head.  Inositol allows me to focus, be calm without trying, think clearly and see things for what they are, not what my OCD mind makes them out to be. I would say my symptoms have been reduced by 85-90% and after 25 years, that is substantial and I feel so blessed to have found this medication.  With regards to side-effects, when I first began taking the medication, I would get a slight headache, a little dizziness and in the evening the drowsiness was more pronounced; but after about a week, those side effects subsided.  On a different note, I have also found that my skin and hair have become healthier; I have a lot more energy; I don't crave sweets as much as I use to and it has boosted my libido exponentially. I know that each individual is different and that this medication affects everyone differently. This is just a short list of all the wonderful things that it has done for me and I would absolutely recommend that anyone with OCD try this medication. I know that it has helped me, more than I could have possibly dreamed.","

"I just started taking 1000 mg of Inositol twice a day to combat PCOS symptoms (particularly weight loss, lethargy, and hirsutism).  My first dose was yesterday evening and within about 10 minutes I noticed a difference in energy and awareness.  This morning I took another dose with the same result.  

I had been frequenting the gym 5 days a week for 45 minutes alternating cardio (3 days) and bootcamp (2 days) throughout the week; however, I had only lost about 6 pounds.  I am a vegetarian and had started using protein shakes to increase my daily protein consumption in hopes to build lean muscle mass to increase my basal metabolic rate with still no significant result in weight loss or bmi reduction.  

For the past 2 months I have been unable to go to the gym and have gained about 10 pounds.  Recently I changed from a vegetarian diet and have introduced lean meat back into my diet.  I average about 1800 calories a day.  

I am hoping that taking 2000 mg of Inositol daily will help me achieve my weight loss goal of at least 80 pounds.  I have read some of the peer reviewed literature that suggested taking 400 mg of folic acid along with the Inositol so I am doing that as well.  I am starting with 1000 mg of Inositol twice a day to see how I respond.  Some of the Inositol research has implemented 4000mg (4g) of Inositol so I could potentially increase my dosage if all goes well with 2000mg.  

I will, hopefully, be going back to the gym after this week at the same frequency I had before, so there will be one week of relatively sedentary activity (desk job) while I am on the supplement.  I will continue posting updates to report the effectiveness of the supplement.

So far, with the increase in energy and perceived increase in cognitive function, I am hopeful that this supplement will help combat my PCOS symptoms.  ","

"I began taking inositol for ocd and anxiety and even at the  fairly low dose of 1.5g,  it was quite helpful.  The problem is that 3 years ago I was diagnosed with transverse myelitis and have a rather large m.s. type lesion on my spinal cord.  It was an awful and very scary experience which caused some residual nerve damage. My neurologist has been watching me closely as sometimes T.M. is the first attack of M.S.. I have had generally good health in the last 3 years and have had no new lesions.  The problem is that every time I go back on inositol, which I am motivated to do because it relieves my ocd, I have steadily worsening residual effects from my intitial attack of T.M.. I have recently been taking it for about 3 months and had to stop as my legs became weaker and weaker and my balance worse and worse.  It took me about 2 years after my T.M. attack to get full strength back in my legs and to not feel and look like I  was drunk when I walked. After this recent period of taking inositol again all my walking problems were steadily coming back.  I had to stop. Two days later I feel 100 percent better.  There is absolutely no doubt to me that the inositol is causing this. When I looked this up on line to see if there is anything written to help me understand why this is occuring I did find a small bit of info saying something about how people with m.s. shouldn't take inositol because it increases killer t cells aand that is not good if you have m.s..  I don't know if theres any truth to that. I do like inositols benefits but 
unfortunately it has a serious downside for me. Just wanted to share my experience.","

"When researching a product for my 9 year old who suffers from mild OCD and fits of rage (since he was very young), I saw good reviews for Inositol.  Ordered the powdered form because reviews said it was absorbed better.  It was extremely easy for him to take since it is tasteless and the product I ordered on Amazon dissolved completely in liguid.  After one dose of 600 milligrams I saw a difference and so did he.  After two, he started to say how it made him feel better.  After three (the next day) he said ""Mom, I think this is how God had wanted me to be."" which said it all!!! This has only been our third day so I am careful to say we have to see, however, his behavior explains it all.  Situations which would have surely ended up in a tantrum now can be discussed and dismissed.  He is still upset by things (doesn't like the smell of canned dog food, doesn't like leggos moved, etc) but he now has ""power"" over his decisions on how to handle the matter.  Sigh... I am so relieved!!!  If you are a parent of a child with abnormal rage then you can relate.  He has not experienced any side effects and we are now doing 12,000 milligrams morining and night.  After reading more great things about Inositol, everyone in the family will now be taking it regularly.","

I haven't noticed a significant reduction in picking at my cuticles, but I have become more aware of it. My symptoms aren't gone, just more mild and manageable. I can feel my brain trying to hold on to the negative thoughts, but they drift away. I also noticed a reduction in my appetite, particularly stress or boredom eating. I am more easily able to break the cycle of negative thinking, and I hope that the effects will become more stable the longer I take the supplement. I would suggest taking with food, if you have a sensitive stomach. It gives me slight acid reflux without food. I take 2-3 650mg pills each day. I might switch to powder if I find the higher doses to be best, as it would be more convenient. I feel this has been very promising so far.","

"What a profound difference this supplement has made in my life! I have been in chronic pain for more than 5 years. Conventional medicine has been somewhat helpful, but left me struggling daily with bouts of intense pain. I discovered this supplement quite by accident a short time ago, and was absolutely stunned by its effectiveness. Including this supplement daily in my treatment has reduced my pain by at least 50%. It also has greatly improved my cognitive skills. For the first time in years, I feel I may be able to 'get my life back'. Why physicians are not recommending this supplement as an adjunct to traditional treatment &/or therapy is beyond me. For this patient, Inositol is priceless!","

I started taking mega doses of Cell Forte IP6 & Inositol (in powdered form) that same day along with Beta1,3d Glucan. I bought these nutritional supplements at my local health food store.  Ten days later on June 29, my surgeon did an excision on my left thigh.

I never had chemotherapy or radiation!  (NOTE: At the time of my diagnosis, I received 100% compensation from the VA, because I was exposed to Agent Orange when I was stationed in Vietnam. That is the cause of my cancer, Leiomyosarcoma.) Also, I continued taking those 2 nutritional supplements for approximately 7-8 months after I was cancer-free. I also bought a juicer, and I juiced fruits and vegetables every day. In addition, I steamed all my vegetables, and I quit eating red meat for 7-8 months. (I never fried anything.)

"I have been using 5 HTP for about a year, and the benefits have been amazing!!!  I've always been prone to depression, both genetically and environmentally.  I have taken Celexa, Wellbutrin (for 2 days, it made me physically ill to the point where I couldn't function!!), Prozac and Lexapro.  The Celexa and Prozac both worked well for about 6 months, and then tapered off.  Increasing the dose had the same effect after a few months.  I weaned myself off the Prozac (with my doctor's approval) during the spring and summer months, and found that with the use of 5 HTP I didn't need to go back on it in the fall for seasonal affective disorder.  At one point I was out of my 5 HTP supplement for about a month, and EVERYONE noticed how much my moods were affected!!!  I felt exhausted, miserable, angry and sad, like having permanent PMS!!!  Within a week of returing to my regular 5 HTP doe, I felt so much better and more in control of my emotions.  I felt normal!!!  This supplement has really been a God-send for me and my loved ones.  It feels great to not be on any antidepressant meds, and to feel good about myself not requiring the medication anymore.  I strongly urge anyone who has depression issues to look into 5 HTP therapy.  It can be used in conjunction with some traditional medications, but you need to check with your doctor.  Please do your research prior to taking any supplement.  I have nothing but good things to say about 5 HTP.  It was definitely the best thing I have ever done for myself (and my husband appreciates it, too!!!).","

About an hour and a half later I had a tremendous ""rush"", tingling and sweating palms, blurred vision, and just generally felt strange and lightheaded. The intense feelings passed within 5 (scary) minutes but I felt restless, tingly, and just generally weird for hours afterward and had trouble sleeping. I still felt ""off"" the entire next day. It did stop my food cravings for a while but with a LOT of uncomfortable side effects. Similar to taking Ecstasy but not as euphoric. If you take it, be careful with the dosage.

It is very hard to find less than 100 mg caps.  My colleague and I both feel we need 50 mgs.  I have had vivid nightmares on this but they have lessened with use. I sleep great and wake feeling better than ever, although hard to go back to sleep if woken up during the night while using it. Recently began to experience unusual aggressive feelings and temper control issues that I have not had before. I noticed an interaction is with Tramadol, which I take sometimes for back pain (Ultram/Ultracet).  I am going to watch this more closely as the aggressiveness has to be linked to the 5 HTP and is quite troubling.  I took a break for a day or two and it subsided greatly.  Overall my mood is better except for these little bouts of hostility which I never had before starting this treatment.

Took on the advice of MD after telling her I felt aging in a really serious way (I am 63). Did not feel depressed. After on a few doses had an amazing wake up to my entire life. I am kinder in dealing with stressful situations and difficult people. I am taking better care of myself. Works better than effexor did years ago during a depressed period. It is changing my life,"

"I am in my early 50's and have been just feeling blah, no energy, not wanting to do anything,just not happy with life. I had also been gaining weight and being very agitated with anyone especially my dear sweet husband whom I would bite his head off at any given moment. My husband wanted me to see a Dr. any Dr.! He couldn't take my mood swings any longer. More than half of the population is on some sort of prescription drug for depression and anxiety and I didn't want to be one more statistic. I did research on serotonin depletion and 5 HTP. I take 50mg at night on a empty stomach as is directed, with any new medication or supplement start with the lowest dose. Also research what are good reputable brands. What a difference it has made in my mood. I have more energy than ever from am to pm. I am happy to get out of bed in the morning, I am sleeping well, the first night I had some strange dreams but that was it. I also take 3mg of melatonin. I don't feel sad or have that blah feeling and I no longer bite my husbands head off! I feel very stable.  I would rather try supplements that are more natural to my body than pharmeceuticals and this one has been a God send. Only side effect, if it is one, is that I don't feel hungry. Maybe the extra weight will finally come off.","

"I have had a clinical depression problem for 28 years, taking Tofranil for 15 years because it was the only drug that really worked well. Because of my age and heart problems Tofranil was causing, i tried 5-HTP as an alternative. At 300 mgs daily i feel wonderful, it works better than any prescription drug i've been on. Also insomnia and over eating that was associated with my depression is gone with no side effects from taking 5-HTP. So please, if you're having depression problems give it a try. I realize not all medications or supplements work well for everyone, but it very well could give you your life back if you're depressed.","

I have been on so many medications that I had terrible side effects and decided I needed a change. And boy I'm glad I did the alternative route. When you take 5 HTP, just make sure you take it with vitamin B3 (niacin) or vitamin c (ascorbic acid). It helps the absorption. Also if you increase the dosage by yourself, do it slowly.

Having suffered from major depression for over a year, declining my doctor's recommendation for SSRIs, I'm frankly surprised that after only 4 days I am feeling better.  Have enjoyed restful sleep for the last 2 nights (first in many months) and feel generally more relaxed and at times even upbeat.  I'm still depressed however am able to fulfil daily tasks & feel some satisfaction; those closest to me have noticed that I seem 'more myself'.  Am curious to see what transpires in coming weeks, as apparently it takes 7-14 days for 5-HTPs full effects to be realized.  Am combining with L-Glutamine.

"I began having issues with depression and anxiety about nine months after my father passed away. With a terminal parent, a new baby and a full time job . . . I never had an oppurtunity to deal with all the emotions and eventually, it hit me like a ton of bricks. 

I didn't even know there was a problem until I had a severe panic attack and ended up in the emergency room. I was put on antidepressents (Lexapro originally and Zoloft after) both of which gave me severe panic attacks and anxiety 24 hours a day. I went from functioning to nonfunctioning almost immediately. I began not being able to sleep and having severe migraine headaches. 

I have begun taking 50 mg of 5-htp every other night along with a multi vitamin and fish oil daily. Of course, I have also done behavioral cognitive therapy and have seen a social worker but I have noticed an amazing difference in my depression and my anxiety has almost completely lifted. I am sleeping again. I feel like myself again only better. I am happy and I truly think it was all of these things put together but 5-htp had alot to do with it.  

I will say that I am 24 years old and am 5'3, 120 lbs. The first afternoon I took 100 mg and it was way too much for me. But the side effects were still not as bad as the antidepressents. I do currently still get headaches almost everyday; however, the duration and severity has improved. Hopefully at some point, these will go away too! But I'll take an aching headache over my previous symptoms anyday. ","

I had been reading about 5-HTP and seeing the results from comments such as below have been having on peoples lives so decided to try for myself.. what did I have to lose right.. ? My MD had scribed Xanax for me... but it was really causing me to detach from life altogether.. 

I was at Costo last week and found Natrol 5-HTP - although dubious yet excited.. I tried the product and have been taking it for a week.. 

Well I honestly have to say.. WOW.. what a difference... No more Mr Snapper Head and now I am feeling like ""normal"".. I have no idea how it performs on appetite control as I am a foodie.. but I can say without a doubt that my mood has lifted and I am out of my funk and thats after 1 week.. I have found that the stupid small stuff in life that would occupy my mind for no reason at all has pretty much gone.. I have started to accept things for what they are and move on.. instead of dwelling and festering on things.. 
So - my opinion - for what it is worth.. go to Costco or the drug store - try it for yourself.. I think you will see a difference.. as so many people like myself have.

"WebMD says not to take 5-HTP till more is known. However, the article is NOT dated! 
There was a scare about 5HTP in 1988 due to a contaminated batch from Japan, coming from the labs of Showa Denko caused 37 deaths and 1500 permanent disablements. 
Controversy at the time between big pharmas, the biotech and FDA resulted in a blanket ban of 5HTP. Pharmas would rather sell you the more expensive SSRI's. Biotech don't want you to know it was Genetic Engineering caused the problem. FDA played safe and banned everything just in case, or maybe under direction from lobbying by big P & BT.
User consensus says 5-HTP is very helpful, and videos on youtube from qualified professionals saying so. 
Me? I found it immensely helpful and get mine from a reputable source. 
If I hear that ""voice of depression"" I take 2 x 50mg tablets of 5 hydroxy tryptophan in the evening, it gives me a great night's sleep, possibly because it also converts to melatonin and significantly elevates my mood in the morning, presumably due to increased serotonin levels. 
I wish WebMD would update their statement to ""avoid"" this very helpful food supplement, and stop misleading people who need help, but they have not responded to my attempts to contact them with links about the original 5HTP contamination. 
Don't cross medicate with SSRI's or MAOI's and it is probably perfectly safe. 
Look up Tryptophan poisoning on google for yourself.

I have been taking 2 5HTP 100 mg at bedtime for almost 10 yrs with Pindolol 10mg (for blood pres). This helps get into the rim stage of sleep so your muscles repair & you sleep more restful. I also take a 5 HTP 100 mg in the AM with my other supplements & prescriptions. It also helps with weight loss.,"

Because I didn't tolerate Sansert (Methysergide) I switched to 5-HTP 200mg 3 times a day and have had at least a 50% reduction in chronic migraine with a much lower risk than Sansert.  Not quite as effective but well worth the trade-off for a much better side effect profile. ,"

I tried it for insomnia and it made me unable to sleep.  When I tried I found myself in some sort of mental zombiland that was somewhere betweeen sleep and consciousness.  When I did drift into a shallow sleep I had horrible nightmares.  My muscles were restless and I kept alternating between hot and cold spells.  The next morning I felt like I hadn't slept in days.  I went to work and couldn't focus and had to go home sick.  20 hours later my head feels swimmy and feel like I've been poisoned.  I will never take this again.  Dosage was one 100mg 12-hour time release Natrol tablet.  I got the pills at Costco (didn't see it in the drop down box so I selected what was closest).  The same day I took the pill I also took a Prisolec and ibuprofen.  I don't know if it was a drug interaction or what but this stuff should be dispensed by a pharmacy.,"

"I started taking 5htp for anxiety and found that it helped me with my ADD which was completely unexpected. Normally, I felt hazy and sluggish which started to be a real problem as I began school at a prestigious college. After the first day of taking 5htp I felt more focused and alert. It acted like a stimulant for me and I even had trouble sleeping the first few weeks. However, others have told me it had the opposite effect on them so I hypothesize that it depends on your already existing serotonin levels. 
I did experience headaches at first but they have now gone away. This did concern me an I would like to know more about the cause.
I also ate less at first, but I now seem to be normalized. It wasn't like being on Ritalin or Adderall where you feel shaky and  the idea of food is repulsive. It's very subtle and you only eat when hungry without overdoing it. 
Overall, 5htp has been a great medication for me. I feel less anxious and with it, I was able to make speeches in public without the crippling fear I had before. ","

"I have suffered from fits of depression and severe anxiety since the age of 14, and have tried countless medications. I was on prozac throughout high school. I am now 21 years old and have no been on any meds for almost two years, but my depression and anxiety were still there. I just didnt want to get back on prozac and seroquel because of the awful side affects. I needed an answer, and after only 5 days I feel an almost complete change in me. I am calm for once, I almost don't know what to do with this feeling!  My sleep is much better, and i am happy. I am no longer crying at every little inconvenience in my life. No longer am I sitting in silence with racing thoughts flooding through my head. I havent been taking 5 htp long, but the difference is phenomenal. I was very skeptical of the medication because of adverse side effects I've had from everything else the doctors are trying to feed every person with depression. It makes me wonder why doctors don't just reccomend 5htp. Oh yeah, because they don't get paid to hand out herbal supplements.","

"I am adult male recently hit 30's. Took 5 HTP regularly 
  about 9 yrs ago, and after the 1st 30 days felt a noticeable
positive difference in my mental well being. Ive always preferred meds w/ as little man made components as possible when given a choice.  There were no side effects for the 4-5 yrs I took it , @ least that I noticed.  Back then, I could only find 5 HTP sold at specialty stores like GNC or online & was $25-30 back then depending on the brand. I regret stopping taking it, as coincidentally i have recently found out I inherited traits for lack of dopamine production ( yes i realize this works on serotonin), similar to Parkinsons , but may be fibromyalgia.  I resumed taking this yesterday , to promote better happiy feeling thru this stressful time. Luckily I found a bottle at wal-mart for less than $10.   thats new : ). It is 100 mg x 100, i read some of you have headaces etc from it. try reducing to 50 mg which was standafd back then if i remember right. so u would want to find non gel tabs if possible or mix half in a drink?  i will report after 30-60 days updafes considering the highr dosage & unverified source where wal mart bought wholesale from

Unfortunately, it also causes me to have severe constipation ( I have long time slow transit colon problems and need surgery to correct it) that makes this a very challenging treatment for me to follow.  I'm going to try taking it just one or two times a week and see if I can manage it that way.  It also caused me to have some very vivid and disturbing dreams, but that was a worthwhile tradeoff considering the total lightening in my mood and outlook from this medicine.

It hasn't reduced my motivation to take on tasks either! I can focus on what I am supposed to do easier because my mind isn't thinking about 10 other things at the same time.
No side effects yet, but I have only taken it for about 3 days. I haven't taken more than 1 100mg capsule a day yet because I haven't felt the need to.

The WebMD information suggests 5-HTP should be avoided, based on data which has already been discovered and dealt with regarding a badly manufactured batch. I suspect WebMD does not want people to know that a safe, cheap, and very effective alternative exists for depression, insomnia, and diet control. There has been alot of inexplicable disinformation about 5-HTP since the late 80s, when the ""heyday"" of Prozac-type SSRIs began. I smell a conspiracy.","

I should warn that through trial and error I've discovered that this supplement is quite powerful. I'm a large person and I cannot handle a dosage more than 50mg. I tried 100mg once and it gave me an upset stomach and headaches.

Ive had problems with depression and anxiety since puberty and this is the only thing that helps. The best effect is how much energy and ambition it gives me. I am normally lethargic with no motivation to do anything without this supplement. 5-htp has helped my grades and social life improve as well as lose weight because it not only suppresses my appetite but give me the energy to go work out. Only issue is an increase in bizarre dreams but I am prone to that problem as I have had night terrors since infancy.,"

Still wake about 3 am but am able to return to sleep easily. 3 positive side effects for me was appetite suppression and I feel less anxious and the tenitis I have had for years is gone.  However, the negative side effect that just started today is extreme dizziness.  If I turn my head up or down on an angle the room spins.  Bending over at the waste to pick my pen off the floor made me so dizzy I fell to my knees.  Walking down the stairs is frightening and there is no way I would attempt to drive.  I suppose I could have a bug.  I'm not sure if I should take the pill tonight or just skip it.

It relieved my anxiety as well as my over-all ability to overcome a lot of the symptoms of menopause. I take one dose two to three times a week. It's frustrating when I am told how dangerous it is to take 5-HTP. The plant that it derives from may have a contaminant, but purchasing it from a reputable manufacturer who purifies the ingredients is recommended. Taking too much may have not be good for you, but isn't that the case with most supplements? They banned Tryptophan when a bad batch was distributed by a Chinese company.

"I started taking 5 HTP by Solgar because I was experiencing very intense PMS that started to last longer than it should and I was super sleepy and tired all the time, didn't want to leave my house. With 2 capsules per day I am now feeling much better, the PMS symptoms are back to normal and reducing more and more, I no longer have cravings or want to kill everyone that disagrees with me. I am sleeping better at nights and not feeling depressed at all. Although, I still have headaches and trying to control my appetite. Besides that, I think they really work great with serotonin levels.","

"taken for long period of time with a few breaks.   Take daily for anxiety.   WATCH YOUR DOSAGE!!!   I cut a 100 mg tab into quarters and take only 1 daily, with very rare taking 2, so that is only 25mg daily normally.    Great treatment, but the dosage may be what causes so many of the problems people describe.   Who ever said that 100mg was a 'correct' dosage so that so many people take it as a minimum??!!??    And taking multiple dosages, or multiple times daily....talk about too much of a good thing!!!   Get a pill cutter, or split your capsules.  

I can feel the impact of the treatment within 10-20 min, calming my anxiety.    I usually take around noon.   Have GAD and have had panic attacks.    Xanax was horrible.  Dropped it quickly....thank God.   Since starting this 5htp treatment, and taking some GABA only at bedtime which I added to the mix about a year ago, no panic attacks at all.  Anxiety, but no panic.    

I do take 10-15mg amitryp at bedtime, which is a VERY SMALL dose, not therapuetic accoridng to Doc, but am very careful still with 5htp and the ami.    Never taken together at same time or too close together.   

I would recommend 5htp without reservation for anxiety, but at a smaller, more controlled, dosage.   ","

I had anxiety bad I worried about my kids birthday parties for a good month before. I also lost weight without dieting. I lost eight pounds in the first two weeks. I figured it this way. I no longer kept to my house, I was outdoors with my kids going shopping and no anxiety eating. Feeling better physically because of the weight loss. I use to be limited to about five minutes of walking and that was painfully. Now I don't even think of it.It sounds stupid to me too but this has government life back that was gone for so long.

"I started taking 200mg 5-HTP spread over two doses each day, not for ""depression"" as such but for low mood.  It's an important distinction as I can't make a recommendation for its effectiveness for severe depression.  However, for my mood, I was amazed!  It really works!  I am noticeably brighter, less negative, more motivated, able to move about quicker and exercise, and my over-appetite and over-sleeping have gone.  I have never found a non-prescription supplement that had such a real effect - none of the others have helped.  However, I am still adjusting to it, since I feel a bit ""wired"" after taking it.  In addition, I have felt a bit of a seratonin ""high"", which is great but I have to adjust to my new emotions as that extra self-confidence could spill over into irritability or feeling more confident expressing inner emotions.  It is not as severe as hypomania, but there is definitely a lift in mood that is a shock to the system.  However, I will give it time because I would rather be like this than feeling dull, flabby and sleepy, any day!  I initially tried just 50mg per day, which is the amount per tablet in the supplement I am taking, but I didn't notice any difference.  However I upped it to 200mg after seeing studies on the internet, and this is having the effect.","

"This comment is for those of you who eventually get side effects.  If you are experiencing anxiety, mind racing, etc after being on 5-htp, this is often the symptoms of serotonin syndrome. It means you do not need that much.  Some of these doses are crazy.  You should also drink green tea eith your 5-htp to protect your arteries (theoretical side effect).  A side BENEFIT of green tea is that it has theanine which will increase other brain chemicals that might be low.  I suffer from moderate to severe depression at times, and can only 50 mg for about 3-4 days before I start suffering from anxiety.  Then I'm good for weeks.  Take your 5-htp...not too much...for whatever amt of days. As soon as you start getting s/e's, this is your threshold. Do not take again till the benefits wear off.  You'll have to play around with this.  I suspect some people may be more sensitive due to various reasons. Maybe even methylation problems.  Also remember serotonin ain't the only kid on the block. If it doesnt work, you may need help with another brain chemical, or multiple.  Be well and God bless.","

"I started taking 5-HTP to help lift my mood and maybe decrease my appetite. It did lift my mood and suppress my appetite but the side effects were not worth the benefits of taking it. 2 days after taking 1 pill per day in the morning I woke up and felt my face twitching. It was more than just twitching, I thought my face muscle was going to pop put of my skin. My face was twitching on the left side below my eye. This continued off and on during the day. I kept taking the 5-HTP in hopes that this was just a fluke and was not related to taking it, although 5-HTP was the only thing I was taking prescription and non prescription.The twitching just became worse and my muscles became very sore primarily in my arms.This twitching would move from one area of my face to another. I had no idea when it would happen and it was scary. I stopped taking the 5-HTP and all of these symptoms stopped. I really wanted to be able to take this because I felt so much better and I believe my family noticed the improvement in mood. My dose was 50 mg per day. I may try it again one dose 1- 2 times a week instead of every day. So far I haven't tried it again. I'm really surprised more people haven't commented on the negative side effects of this. I used Natures Way 5-HTP 50 mg tablets.

"I have had depression since I was in my 20's and I'm 63 now and have probably taken every antidepressant on the market.  I was recently diagnosed with Sjogrens Syndrome...and antidepressants cause dry mouth and also dry eye.  Cymbalta was making me miserable with the dry, painful eye symptoms.  So I got off of it after taking it for years, it was horrible getting off of it.  I read on a dry eye blog that 5-HTP didn't cause dry mouth or dry eyes, so I thought I'd give it a chance.  I started  off slowly 100mg extended release and worked up to 200 mg extended release.  I feel wonderful, better than I EVER felt on regular anti-depressants.  My eyes got much better although I still have Sjogrens Syndrome.  But my eyes are extremely painful now that I'm off all anti-depressants.  I've read that some people have stomach issues with this, I haven't.  You'll just have to see what's right for your body.  But I've been on this for over a year now and feel better than I ever have.  My husband says I'm more myself.  I've also read that its helped some people with sleep, not me.  I'm bi-polar so I often have sleep issues.

Just recently, I weaned myself off of Pristiq 50 mg because of the usual side effects (fatigue/feeling like a zombie/apathy) after taking it for 3 years.  Of course, within 8 weeks, the panic attacks resurfaced.  After researching natural methods and reading reviews, I tried the 5 htp 50 mg (Natrol). Initially, some nausea and headaches and fatigue, as well as difficulty staying asleep through the night.  But the results ARE immediate, with NONE of the other horrible side effects I've always experienced with prescription medication.  My body has adjusted, so no fatigue or nauseau - took it with ginger for 2 weeks, now I don't need to.  I've experimented with taking it in the morning or at night, morning works for me.  Because I'm still having some mild panic sometimes during the night, I'm going to gradually increase the dose - taking 50 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night.   If you experience side effects from other meds, I suggest starting at the lowest dose possible - it seems to be working great!   I will NEVER take a prescription med for anxiety again - it's like poison in your body as far as I'm concerned.  (good old big pharma)..","

I have never had back pain, however, in the last few days I have had tremendous low back pain and the only thing I am doing different is taking the 5HTP 100 mg a day.  I am going to stop taking this medication immediately as a side effect is eosinophilia-myalgia synddrome.  Hopefully, the pain goes away once I stop the 5-HTP.  ","

My appetite has become smaller and therefore I am eating slightly less. I have continued to exercise twice a week and I've lost 2lbs a week. The only side effect I have noticed is that is appears to cause spotting. I stopped taking it for two weeks when my period started and since I have started it again 3 days ago, the spotting has returned. I'm on the implant which is a progesterone only contraceptive. The spotting is a nucience but so far the benefits have outweighed the side effects. I will continue to take it for 4 weeks at a time and then take a break.","

I wasn't eating and experiencing sleep maintenance insomnia. At first, I felt no different but after a week my sleep started to get closer back to normal and my appetite returned. After two weeks, my anxiety started to lift and I was having normal thoughts again. I am not completely back to normal at this point, still have an overall down mood and feel that tense knot in my chest but my days went from horribly unbearable to manageable.

"I originally reviewed this in February, and stopped treatment (50 mg 1x per day, one month) as it affected my ability to stay asleep.   I am extremely sensitive to any psychoactive medications, so it's not surprising.   Also, my night time panic attacks continued.  I have since switched to using 100 mg Rhodiola Rosea 1x per day in the morning and supplementing with Magnesium citrate, Natural Vitality's powder as recommended from a friend.  I take the magnesium drink in the evening and it works as well as melatonin, without the crazy dreams.  I've noticed a calming affect after only one dose!!  My night time panic is definitely subsiding, but still waking up several times during the night.  In addition to eating well  and increasing my exercise regimen, so far, both of these supplements seem a little gentler on my system.  Also, I use Lemon Balm tea as needed for anxiety in the afternoons.  Always start slow and listen to your body - everybody is different.","

"After dealing with anxiety and depression for the past two years, doctors decided to put me on Zoloft. They put me on a normal starting dose, and by day 5 I had serious symptoms of serotonin syndrome. It was terrifying. I was discouraged, but a friend of mine told me about 5-HTP. I have been taking it for about 2 weeks now and I felt the positive effects by the 2nd day. I sleep better, I eat better, I'm not foggy anymore, and the general anxiety that looms throughout my day is almost all gone. I'm pretty amazed with how well this works. One negative side effect I've experienced is diarrhea. Yet that is manageable compared to depression.
I take one 100mg pill in the morning when I wake up.
Hope this helps, and best of luck to you!","

I began with a 100 mg tablet by Natrol per day after lunch. After day 2 I started to experience light headedness, headache,dizziness, brain fog, muscle weakness/pain/numbness, vivid dreams and waking nightmares, muscle twitching, chills, chest pain. I thought I might be taking too much so I lowered my dose after a few days to 50mg per day at lunch. The vivid dreams went away along with the muscle twitching and chest pain. But the other problems still persist, its been one week and im starting to have trouble sleeping. I'm feeling sick and run down. Im surprised by how little side effects are mentioned by others, so I needed to share my experience. Way too many serious side effects!","

I figured seen a lot of do doctors for my fibromyalgia and got no where and definitely wasn't going to let the same doctors touch my brain. So I did a lot of research and it took me till 6 months to find 5-htp. I can't function without it.The day I got my 5-htp in the mail, I took it around 1pm and my husband and I noticed a big change in my memory improving tremendously by 5mp the same day. The 5-htp that I was taking that worked amazingly. Within 2 weeks my memory seemed better then ever. I started working ng on my speech, memory recal, my sentences just flowed. I was correcting other people instead of them correcting me. The brand is by ""just potent. Then about 2 months into taking the 5-htp the manufacturer was out of stock, so I bought some other brand and it didn't work! The company Just Potent is only brand that seems to work and the only one that carries 400mg. I will back this product to heaven and back.It is reasonablely priced at $24.99 on Amazon or the Just Potent web site.","

I have been taking 2 x 50 mg tablets daily for almost 6 months and my anxiety has almost all but disappeared. This coming from somebody who suffered from chronic anxiety is some claim. The process has been extremely gradual with the effects being more noticeable as time has passed. I have experienced no side effects whatsoever. My only moan would be that the tablets are quite expensive but that is a small price to pay metaphorically speaking. I will continue to take these tablets for the foreseeable future.,"

I take the time release version, 200 mg and I love it. I used to fell anxiety build up internally as stressful situations popped up and it would build and I'd be stressed out all night. Ever since I began taking 5-HTP I have been more calm and handle stress with a more relaxed attitude. I used to feel more volatile and would over react at times. Plus, I used to feel overwhelmed and depressed if things in my life didn't go well. Now I take them with a grain of salt and don't let things bother me as much. Life's challenges never go away but if you can deal with them with a level head and without anxiety I think it's easier to solve problems and be the leader you need to be.

It certainly did help the depression but it usually made me feel sleepy during the daytime, in such a way that I couldn't really concentrate on my studies. It kind of 'paralyses' your mind and thats probably why it works great as an anti-depressant. I wouldn't recommend anyone to take this supplement for longer periods of time because it can potentially upset serotonin/melatonin balance in the body(probabably accounting for some of the adverse effects experienced). I personally use it incidentally(thats like 5 times a year) and when I do it helps me relax and sleep better. I don't use it when I have to be productive the next day. ","

These things take time, about 2 weeks to fully feel the effect on your mood and sleep patterns. I was disappointed the first time I took it because the recommended dose wasn't enough, but I didn't know any better. My friends mom works at the store I got them from and she said you got to take like 3x the recommended dosage... I took 3- 50mg chewables, 3x a day, and it worked like a charm! The vivid dreams are normal, if you're suffering from insomnia, you're just not used to them. I was freaked out by my dreams for a while; getting more deep REM sleep gives you a more intense dream. There was a few times when I was tired during the day, and a little groggy... but I never slept better, and I was as happy as a kindergartner fingerpainting!","

I also have the weird dreams described by many others. It does, however, seem to ease some the indigestion and body aches I have experienced since menopause began. I bought fairly high dose capsules so have moved to taking this every other day. I do better on the day I don't take it. I will try taking 50 mg 20 minutes before a meal 3x a day, as recommended by Dr. Oz, and see if the supplement works better. If not, I'm done.","

"Totally recommend this to anyone. I have been suffering with depression,so bad that i would just sleep for days just to stay alive. up to the point where if there was stressfull situation,my body's response was immediate sleepiness,as in my sleep i feel safe and like i can run away from it all. 
i also suffer from terrible pms( worsened due to hormone imbalance caused by endometriosis and ovarian cysts): whole spectrum of moodswings.I would yell at people,unable to stop myself,after i have yelled at them,i would sit and cry,because it feels awful to know why it happened,but that i wasnt able to stop myself,i would end up selfloathing and hating myself.
been taking 5HTP for a month now 200mg in the morning and 200mg in the evening. my moodswings have stopped,i dont feel like i want to curl under the rock and sleep till all my problems are gone,anymore. /i dont yell at people,dont burst into tears either. just feel very levelled and focused. this doesnt make you feel high,or silly'happy',neither it makes you feel drowsy. in fact it doesnt feel like its affecting me physicaly at all. MENTALLY THOUGH I FEEL NORMAL NOW,THE WAY I WAS BEFORE I GOT DEPRESSED. it really is a miracle,like if someone's climbed in my head and put everything on the right shelves is best way i can describe it. i have tried valiums (diazepams )before ,and sometimes even 10mg wouldnt help,all it did was make me drowsy and numb. its also addictive. iam currently not taking anything else with 5htp,as i wanted to see if it would do anything,well i dont need anything else,this is my best discovery,something i really never expected to work,considering its herbal. hope it works as well for others as its worked for me.i noticed improvement within a week,though i wasnt sure if its not a coincidence,now after a month,i can certainly say,this does work.","

"I have been suffering from extreme mood changes for a very long time such as depression, rage, and anxiety. Lately it has been resulting in suicidal thoughts and actions. While hesitant on going to the doctor and begin taking ""Hard-core"" prescriptions, I decided to try 5htp. After making sure it doesn't interact with any other prescriptions and supplements (www.drugs.com)I have been taking 2 100mg 5htp capsules for 3 nights in a row now. Haven't had any suicidal thoughts but its still too early to tell if it's working. Also I'm having a hard time going to sleep and staying asleep these last 3 days- often times having to stay in the living room to avoid tossing and turning and waking my bf up. Hopefully 5htp is the answer for those extreme mood patterns without having to go on ant-depressants with crazy side effects- I am going to give it two weeks to really see if there is a result. On top of that I eat pretty healthy and seek spiritual help- (although clearly this is not enough- I feel I really do have a serotonin level that needs to be adjusted) Also I really hope this insomnia goes away after my body gets more used to taking 5htp- I'm going to start taking it in the late afternoon instead of night to see if that will help. Will post back if any results or side effects become more apparent.","

"I take a 100mg pill in the morning every 4-7 days and its very good for treating depression. Effects usually hit 2-4 hours after taking it: general boost in mood, difficult to think negative thoughts, warm fuzzy feeling, sometimes even euphoria. Feelings of love, from loving what you're doing, to feeling better about people around you. Similar feeling to MDMA. I don't know why, it might just be my experience, but the effects seriously last 3 days or so. Then for about 3-4 more days just a general content feeling. After about a week you're back at baseline but I swear that's better than before when I never took any anti-depressants. 

BTW, messing with serotonin is dangerous, why I've never sought to get prescribed SSRIs or anything. That's why I only take 1 100mg pill every few days, it only takes a small amount to change the balance of serotonin in your brain. It takes other chemicals in your brain to work....so too much, and you might not even feel the desired effects, just the bad side effects. 100mg/day to me would be crazy. Side effects include a stiff jaw/temples, headaches, stomachache, vomiting, and can last as long it takes for your body to clear all the serotonin. I also don't take it at night as jaw clenching can be bad at night, sometimes even at my low dosage.","

I have been struggling with depression and anxiety lately and decided to go back to taking this after losing all motivation for things and needed a ""pick me up"". My previous experience I used the recommended dose of 100 3x a day and it caused me to have more anxiety and lethargic feelings which I cannot surely say it was from the 5-HTP. However, this time taking it I have found a sweet spot in dosing and it has kick started a incredibly productive time full of optimism and positivity. I am pretty impressed to say the least. That one little pill a day has caused me to completely turn my mood around into something so positive so that I could go about my day with productivity again. I can also note that my sleep schedule and problems with insomnia have completely dissolved allowing me to have peaceful yet deep slumber every single night. I go to sleep and wake up in the same spot! I wake up feeling ready to start the day instead of wishing I had a few more hours to sleep. A side effect to take into consideration before trying out 5HTP is increased dreaming. It caused my first full blown lucid dream and has made my dreams more lucid and intense. To me it was a good side effect but it may be bothersome for others. Overall, I will continue to take one a day and see how far this goes. ","

"Hi. I feel it's my duty to let everybody know that 5-htp actually works. I'll be honest with you and admit that I've been experimenting with MDMA, which on some occasion brought me lows (depression) for a few days after consuming it. Hearing it can help manage those symptoms, I decided to buy it. (It's really a harm reduction strategy and not an encouragment do to MDMA!)

Since buying 5-HTP, I've taken it twice, and NOT after MDMA but while completely sober and feeling fine, and unexpectedly it made me a whole lot more content and healed some low level anxieties. It actually made me feel good and not crave any kind of drug to make me more happy (i.e. alcohol, tobbaco, MDMA). It's not that I'm an addict by any means, but I often have this desire to get f****d up for no good reason really. It also made me sleep a whole lot better, without waking up during the night, and the dreams were crazy vivid and life-like but I liked it, it's interesting. Oh yeah, and there were some ""side effects"": sleepines, perhaps not feeling mentally as sharp, feeling a bit mellowed out. Well, it's not that any of these are bad by themselves, but they can sort of have an effect on your productivity. Taking it before bad is probably the wisest, so you sleep it over. :)

I forgot to mention: The first time I took 200 mg and I think it was a bit too much. I was feeling very balanced and in good mood, but overpowered by side effects. Second time it was 50 mg before sleep.

I'm not saying I'll start to use it regularly, but I can see it's potential for reducing depression and anxiety. It's legal and it really does have an effect which is definietly not placebo. I personally could probably reccomend it even for just having fun or relaxing. Why not take 100 or 200mg and chill out with friends? It does have some slightly euphoric effects. IMO far better and helthier than drinking booze or doing some drugs to achieve that feeling or get rid of anxieties. Just a thought!

Wish you the best :)","

I was crying for hours almost every day, didn't want to go to school or work, then I felt a smoothness to my life I hadn't felt before.  This amino acid saved me, honestly.

"Took for 2 days in a combo herb supplement for sleep from Whole Foods. The 2nd day I had severe numbness and tingling in my feet and up my legs. My arms were becoming numb too. I looked it up on the internet and found that this herb can cause an incurable disease called EMS (Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome). People have died from this disease. In 1989 there was an outbreak of it from Tryptophan. Numbness and tingling in the feet is one of the symptoms. I was scared to death. I waited a week to see if the ""pins and needles"" went away but they didn't, so went to an Urgent Care. They took my blood and urine. After 5 days they told me that my test results were normal but wanted me to get tested again. Now after 3 weeks the pins and needles are going away. I seem more sensitive now to other side effects though. I would never touch this again. L-Tryptophan is the same thing. I think it should be banned.","

"I had been in a relatively light but still very draining depression for the past year or so. I used 5-HTP a few times before but it was never when I was really depressed so all it did was give me a calmer feeling and slight contentment. This week I started using 5-HTP again, with doses averaging 300-500mg a day. By the very first few days I have already noticed an increased mood, and more positive thinking. I had already begun a change in my mentality before the 5-HTP that was pulling me out of my depression but the 5-HTP just catapulted me straight upwards and I feel that it is speeding the process. Somedays I just look around me and am in this feeling of wonder and aliveness. It's like that feeling of life has been handed back to me. It's very meditative. I would recommend this BUT I am worried about heart valve issues if used for a long-term time, so I will be weaning off of this slowly now as I believe I have already gained what I wanted from it. Though I do think the heart valve damage is very unlikely with normal use, as one study I read used HEROIC doses on rats for 3 months, no human being is likely to be using such doses so as long as you make this a short treatment, it is wonderful!","

"(Part 2) 
Today is the 4th day of taking 5-HTP. I still feel sad, have negative thoughts and bouts of anger, but they quickly dissipate and no longer linger on to consume me like what they used to. There’s this sense of calmness that is allowing me to make sound judgements and decisions without being hampered by negative feelings all the time. I feel like the decisions that I make will lead to positive results, as opposed to bad endings that I used to feel prior to taking 5–HTP.
Might be too early, but I can safely say that I am no longer a victim of my own depressive thoughts.  I am no longer a person who is constantly sad and angry. The only flip side is that 5-HTP does wreak some havoc in my stomach and I feel bloated with gas at times. But it does seem to feel less intense as the days go and I am hoping that my gut will get used to this supplement. 
Overall, what a miracle supplement. My only regret is that why didn't anyone informed me about 5-HTP earlier. I feel as if so many decades of my life wasted on being weary all the time and so many days and opportunities to seek happiness were missed. Nonetheless, better late than never.

"I started taking 5-HTP for depression and anxiety. I experienced results within three days of taking 50mg once a day in the AM. It works for me, YMMV. The mood effect is subtle but consistent. My mood feels more stable, particularly more resilient. I have fewer anxiety spikes.

I didn't take it for sleep disturbance, but it has improved the quality of sleep significantly. I wake up much earlier and without grogginess when I've taken it the day before. I also have dreams that I remember. Part of the stress resilience I feel may come from the effects the 5-HTP has had on my sleep.

It's probably not a plug-and-play supplement that can safely be taken on its own. Do your research. I take l-tyrosine with it (to prevent dopamine depletion/imbalance). The recommended ratio is 10:1, but my body seems to do better with 5:1. Because 5-HTP can cause heart valve damage via increased peripheral serotonin, I take EGCG (which effectively neutralizes the peripheral serotonin that doesn't make it past the BBB) and omega-3 (to increase bio-availability of the EGCG).","

I wasn't getting a restful nights sleep and I could feel my anxiety just eatting at me all day long. I've tried medications from my doctor but they make me feel fuzzy minded and kinda (zombiefied) so I quickly stopped them. After starting 5-HTP within days my mood changed drastically. I took one pill in the morning on a empty stomach and about a hour later I felt so much better, positive and happy. When I wake up in the morning I feel like I've had a great night sleep.

"I've been feeling depressed for so long I can't remember when things were different. Only recently have I admitted to myself the seriousness of what's going on. I've tried 5-htp: 100 mg extended release twice daily and I noticed a positive change BUT seemed to always get tired late in the afternoon. Crazy as it sounds it did not help with evening sleep. I've switched to only one pill a day and have not concluded any definite result. I might try CBD in place of the one omitted pill, or might reverse the schedule for when to take the 5-htp. If I didn't get so tired I'd give it a 5-star rating. I've got to admit that sometimes I get so desperate for one good day that I'd try almost anything. Depression can be very frustrating, always getting your hopes up only to be let down. I should note that I've been taking 5-htp for about 5 weeks. By the way, I have gone the route of prescribed meds with bad luck results. I don't intend to return to any of them. I've tried to be straight here because I know that what works or doesn't work for me may not be the same for you. It all seems to be a wait and see approach similar to prescribed meds. Something my doctor says, ""try this and if it doesn't work we can try something else"". After a while it grows old.","

"I haven't taken them consistently as I am like that when it comes to medicine. I started taking them in August 2012. Within the first two weeks of taking them off and on, I lost 8 pounds and have not gained them back.  That was with changing my diet, but without exercise.  I take the Raspberry Ketone + Green Tea by Futurebiotics LLC.  Each pill has 300mg of Raspberry Ketones and 200mg of Green Tea extract. You only take ONE pill PER DAY either at breakfast or lunch. SIDE EFFECTS - I have noticed that you have to drink LOTS of water or you will become constipated.  Also, you will smell the scent of raspberries when you go #1! :-) I just started taking them again and exercising today. I want to see if there's a difference in how quickly the weight comes off.

"I started taking Raspberry Keytone on 22 March 2013....within a couple days I noticed light headed symptoms once in a while....within a week these symptoms increased in frequency and were accompanied by blood rushes and instances where I felt I would pass out.  On  4 April I was feeling so bad that I went to the emergency room.  My blood pressure was 202 over 107!!!  I DO NOT HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE!!!  ER staff did blood work, CT scan, urinalysis, EKG....all came back normal.  On 5 April 2013 I went to my doctor 's office and my blood pressure was still very high....I quit taking Raspberry Keytone and within 2 days the lightheaded feeling has all but totally disappeared and I no longer have the blood rushes!!!  I see my doctor in 2 weeks and we will discuss weaning off the blood preassure med.  SO BEWARE raspberry keytones could be very very dangerous to your health!!!!


The Unknown Potential for Harm

Raspberry ketones in food and cosmetics are generally considered safe. But no one knows what short- or long-term effect raspberry ketone supplements could have on your overall health. That's because there has been no study to document potential side effects. There are also no studies that look at potential drug or food interactions.

The fact that raspberry ketones chemically resemble other stimulants suggests the potential for certain side effects. And there are anecdotal reports of jitteriness, increased blood pressure, and rapid heartbeat among people taking raspberry ketone supplements. But without the evidence, no one can say what dosage of raspberry ketone supplements, if any, might be safe to take","

"What some folks dont realize is products such as raspberry ketones are designed to set up a positive environment within your body to metabolize fat better. People have a tendency to be over concerned with weight vs body mass index or bodyfat percentages.

These products work better in a stack combination and with a healthy diet and regular exercise.  These products dont give you a license to be less active and eat junk food.

Raspberry ketones are a natural phenol, organic compound responsible for creating the aroma in red raspberries. Raspberry ketones have been suggested to boost metabolic functioning and promote lipid utilization.* The primary mechanism of action is a result of their ability to manipulate the enzyme lipase. Lipase facilitates the breakdown of fat cells, so the increase in lipase activity due to raspberry ketones may result in a greater amount of fat cells being broken down and burned as fuel during training sessions and everyday activities.","

"SCAM  RASPBERRY KEYTONE diet pills

I recently signed up for a free sample of raspberry keytone diet pills   and a second diet pill as advertised on a Facebook page and I was to pay for postage only which I did. 

I have since been deducted €120.79 and €113.16 in addition to conversion fees. I am furious to say the least and will stop at NOTHING to get my money back. 

I have been misled by the advertising and the hidden terms and conditions and believe they have not complied with the regulations by failing to provide you with all the information in the contract in writing.

they are also in beach of the consumer protection (distance selling) regulations 2000. 

I have lodged a complaint with EU consumer rights and with the European consumer rights and began a civil action against them as I returned the product to the address provided to get a refund and the parcel was returned to me twice, once by registered post and again by ordinary post. Then they told me to reply by email giving them a tracking number for a refund which I did. I have still not received a refund. 

It is a terrible scam. Don't be caught out. Spread the word.

I'm a type 2 diabetic with PCOS.  Losing weight is difficult at best.  I started using a large dose as suggested by the show.  This dosage was difficult to find online.  I take a 1000mg per day.  It did not help me lose any weight, or at least not in the long term.  At first the most dramatic side effect was blood sugars.  My blood sugars dropped dramatically.  I went from taking 60 units of insulin to 28 units in a short amount of time.  It was a dramatic decrease and caused low blood sugars.  You would have to be careful with your dosage/supplier.  I've continued with the same brand for over two years now and have no known side effects besides lower my blood sugar.  After an initial weight loss of 60 lbs that included many other treatments, I haven't found that the keytones are anything other than helpful with my blood sugars.  I keep taking them for the help in the blood sugars.  ","

Razberi-K by Kleissinger Labs.  After one month I gained over 8 lbs despite increasing exercise and cutting out sugar.  Thinking it was coincidence I tried again 1 year later and gained 3 lbs in the first week.  I contacted the company with no reply. This product doesn't work and there is no support.

Before taking it I felt edgy and mentally fatigued.   I seemed to have lost  my patience for mundane questions.   I was snappy.   Now I feel more energy and an overall happiness.

"Suffered depression from chronic stress from over a decade in my profession. I am in a high-performance sales profession with my compensation tied to using interpersonal skills and group presentations. Not a drinker or drug user (prescription or otherwise) so the sudden onset of chronic depression was surprising. Spoke to my primary care doc who prescribed zoloft. Reaction to this drug was extremely negative(constant extreme anxiety, paranoia and even a brief period of suicidal thoughts). Stopped zoloft and tried exercise plus diet and although I was not as bad, I still had issues. Read about rhodiola root and decided to try it due to the low toxicity. Started with 100 mg/day and within 24 hours I could feel the benefit. I wasn't in a permanently bad mood. After 2-3 days I was slipping back to brief anxiety attacks. Raised it up to 200 mg/day (first thing in the morning before breakfast and 30 minutes before lunch). 3 weeks later and I'm 100% better. I no longer have anxiety attacks even when doing presentations in front of large audiences. This herb has changed my life. I've read hours and hours of different reviews of various herbs and remedies. One thing I've learned is that each body is different and you'll need to try to see what is right for you. For me, this root has helped me. I've been fighting an inner battle of anxiety during public speaking for many years and no longer even have this issue. I feel liberated now that I have found a better chemical balance. I am concerned that my body will change and go back to the prior issues but for now I am happy again.","

"Have used this root for 2 years with resounding success. I've dealt with severe depression my whole life and have been healing for the past few years. I used to take the extract, then the pills, now I purchase the actual dried root and chew 1/4 tsp of that every morning and sometimes a little more around 2/3:00 (do not take it after 5 as it will keep you up). The dried root is MUCH more affordable and it's pretty delicious after you get past the rooty flavor. (usually let my saliva break it down then chew it) This root is immediately uplfting, energizing, and it sticks with me through the day, letting my energy lower after about 8 hours so I fall asleep peacefully. I clean houses, and I hardly go a day without it, it is non-addictive and will not produce jitters or nervousness of any kind. You almost can't OD on it, but there are some concerns for heart conditions (usually only if you take a lot). Of course do your own thorough research and make your own well informed decision. I trust ancient cures more than something cooked up in a lab with only two years of ""research"" any day. Namaste. ","

"I turned to rhodiola because I am experiencing peri-menopausal irritability and mood swings, and in general have always suffered from fatigue. For those problems, rhodiola has been remarkable. It provides an uplifted, buoyant feel and a sense of energy, without the jittery feeling I get when I used to drink caffeine for energy. So, for mood and energy I've found it to be great. HOWEVER, both my husband and I have noticed a notable loss of memory when taking it--can't remember names of people, or can't put a face with a name when I otherwise would. This change in memory was troubling enough that my husband quit using rhodiola. I try to use it only during the last two weeks of my cycle, when I am most prone to mood problems, and try to put up with the memory problems then.  I do worry, though, about what everyday or longterm use would do to memory.  I hope researchers will look into this rhodiola/memory connection. Maybe one could even learn more about memory illnesses by understanding what the herb does to brain chemistry and how that's connected to memory.","

I never bothered to review it until now when i was just about to take my daily vitamins & give it another go.. anyways i thought i should look it up & read the benefits- it all seemed great, then i read the reviews & i found that someone else had the itchy bumps/hives occur..

The only drawback to it is that it causes mild constipation. But fortunately (I guess?) its maximum benefit is maxed out at about 6 weeks usage, after which I've heard it's recommended that you go off it for a while before starting another 6 week dose. So the side effect doesn't have much time to cause discomfort before you're off it again.","

I was generally run down. Suffering from stress and depression due to work and caring for elderly parents. I had an ulcer and bronchitis. After recovering from these illnesses I was always exhausted by the end of the work day and had no energy for anything else. after a couple of weeks I began to feel generally better. Now I feel great. I don't feel like crying all the time and have energy to do the things I love instead of being a couch potato who fell asleep on the couch every evening. I also feel like being social again. Before taking Rhodiola I didn't want tomgomout at all and stayed at home as much as I could. My entire attitude to life has changed. I had a complete hysterectomy at the age of 45 and everything gradually went downhill until now. Feeling well and wanting to do things again has also helped me lose weight and I am much better at coping with the worry of two 90 year old parents with significant health issues.

I will cut back the dose and change the schedule I'm using and see if that helps.  Seems like a good product if your depression is stress-induced, or if you have anxiety issues.","

"I have adult ADHD and Bipolar 2. The (prescription) treatments I have been given felt like I'd been given a T-shirt and shorts to get through an Alaskan blizzard. My underlying system just felt ravaged with age and coping for all this time (I wasn't diagnosed till age 43). I couldn't cope, there was nothing left in the tank.     I came off the prescription meds and started doing things to get my thyroid working, the cortisol down and generally get my system working for itself again. Vit C, B Complex,Vit D,Magnesium, Rhodiola Rosea and lots of hiking in the cold clear air of the countryside. My energy levels and coping mechanisms are getting better and I do feel like my system is healing. The downsides are, I don't sleep enough really, I get a strange hour of anxiety/paranoia in the late evening (some days) and I sort of blank out one or two negative people in my life which is probably good in the long term but in the short term its bad for keeping the peace in my environment (and lets be honest, do these people give a damn if their behaviour affects your health?). So all in all a positive experience though I will have to take a break in the future to catch up on the sleep. ","

I immediately noticed that I was less fatigued, but I also discovered that if I didn't take the supplement early in the morning, I had difficulty falling asleep. I also wish to report that this supplement causes me to have outrageously weird dreams!  At first I thought it might have this reaction just on me, so without telling my daughter of the dreams, she tried a capsule 
ONCE.  The following day I told her about my crazy dreams, & she said that she had them also!  Therefore, I am not the only one that this root supplement affects in this way.","

"This is my honest review, I have no reason to sugar coat it.  I read the reviews of R. rosea, and they were almost all positive, so I bought the Swanson 400mg capsules just because I was curious about it.  I am overly sensitive to a lot of drugs.  Two beers and I'm buzzed, one cup of coffee and I'm super jittery and can't sleep.  So I knew I needed a smaller dose.  It's apparently hard to find in capsules smaller than 400mg.  So I have been unscrewing the capsule and taking only about 1/8 to 1/4 of it (50-100mg), just once in the morning when I wake up, and only take it once every 2 days.  It definitely has stimulant properties.  I've seen many benefits and only 1 or 2 negatives (that may go away over time).  Benefits: More energy, similar to caffeine but without feeling jittery, and no afternoon crash.  Better focus at work without getting tired, along with less anxiety from work stress (priceless). A slight euphoric feeling for the first couple of hours after I take it.  A slight increase in heart rate.  Less snack cravings.  I feel more outgoing and less introverted (I'm normally a quiet guy).  My workouts have been easier in terms of perceived effort, and I feel less tired afterward.  I seem to recover faster than before.  Last but not least I have noticed my libido increase, which I honestly didn't expect at all.  The negatives: I get a slight headache about 2 hours after I take it, and it goes away by the afternoon.  The headaches seem to be going away slowly as I get accustomed to it.  The night of the first day I took it, I went to bed still having a lot of energy, and was unable to sleep for a while, so I took a tylenol pm, and fell right asleep.  Overall though, it's been great.  So glad I discovered it, and thanks for everyone who posted reviews of it!!","

Many doctors tried to help me in many ways, in vain, since several years!!! Now, thanks to Rhodiola (Now~s product) the world seems to be a better place. Yes, on my face there are since i take it lil red bumps, but its okay.
People say, im a better person now. And im loosing weight, what was impossible because of PCOS, my neck was way thicker because of my thyreoid glands. (I take also natural organic green tea and dont eat charbolhydrates after 3 pm by the way.)
I take daily 2x500 mg of this capsules, in the morning before breakfast and before lunch. Sometimes i take the second later. Better mornings! Better start of the day!
Even if i take it later, my sleep wont suffer it badly! But we all react different, keep in mind. I have ambitions again, its unbelievable! I take it now since a month. I can recover from stressy situations very fast!! I never in my life could take stress, and it seems like, thanks to rhodiola, i can bear it now. ","

"Unsatisfied with the medical advice of ""wait and see what happens"" regarding my chronic fatigue, I did extensive literary research and came across this promising little herb. I've been taking a  300mg capsule with breakfast daily and have found it keeps me alert for longer in the day without the 'buzz' of caffeine. It helps me feel normal again. I feel it also helps anxiety, seasonal depression and a low libido. For people who feel drained this can help, but I'm not sure it would add much to someone who's already healthy. Downsides: it is expensive, and studies suggest not exceeding a 1000mg daily in-take, so be careful if you're buying the herb loose. More randomised control trials investigating its efficacy would be great too.","

"I am hypothyroid and although my levels are good/normal (T3 and T4), I still get lethargic sometimes; especially mid-afternoon. Taking royal jelly, I sleep better, I awake with energy (mental and physical) and I get a lot more done. It gives me the energy I need to exercise (sometimes I feel like I NEED to exercise just to use up all the energy I get from Royal Jelly). Use of the product does not make you feel altered or jittery. I just feel like I have the energy I did as a teenager and young adult. When I run out of R/J and go more than 3 weeks before getting more, I start to feel listless again; not having the energy or enthusiasm to do more than the things that I have to do to get by in a day.

"Fresh Royal Jelly: I took it for several months (from 1/4 to 1/2 tsp/day)...it cleared up a dermatological condition within a month or two (I was previously on antibiotics for skin issue). I believe this may boost the immunological/immune response in the body. I ran out of Royal Jelly...the condition returned in a few months (under stress). I just started back on Royal Jelly and have noticed my skin condition is again improving within very short time. I order through Stakich...they don't import or reconstitute from powdered form like some royal jelly marketers do..Stakich farms bees and gathers the different products up in Michigan. Highly recommend this product unless your 1) Allergic to it 2) It interacts with your meds, such as Coumadin & other blood thinners as it increases the effects of them. It tastes very sour at first, but somehow you'll come to like it or at least not find is so tart/sour after a week or two. Hey, IF it's good enough for the Queen Bee...who am I to turn it down!

"I've taken pure, fresh RJ daily for 20yrs now & I never have had any side effects what-so-ever, however, it doesn't taste good at all. Benefits are: lots of energy, reduces stress, sleep soundly(no tossing or turning), helps control symtoms of menopause to name just a few. I don't eat healthy at all, plus I smoke cigarettes & drink soda daily so I'm not a very healthy person, but I do eat RJ every single day, I also consistantly ate RJ throughout both my pregnancies - 1st child was 7lbs 15ozs & born 1wk early/breast fed 4 months, 2nd child was 9lbs 8ozs & born 1 wk late/breast fed only 3-4 wks. Both children have beautiful skin & hair, they rarely get sick, A+ students & most of all NO ALLERGIES, NO ASTHMA & NO SKIN DISORDERS OF ANY KIND - VERY HEALTHY!  They are now age 19 & 16. The only drawback I can think of is that I am over 50 yrs old & have a full 5 day menstral cycle. :( 
(I think the RJ is keeping me very fertile) Its GREAT stuff! I recommend it to everyone, especially to those with ailments. If you can't stand the taste, try the freeze dried capsule form, but you need to take at least 2-3 per day.  Also, in any form, you need to give it time to work for you - at least 1-2 months.","

Saw Palmetto gave me relief in about a week, and was adequate treatment for over twenty years.  A year ago I needed further treatment so my doctor prescribed Finasteride, which I took for one year.  I lived with the unpleasant side effects of the Finasteride for the year.  At my last exam the doctor was satisfied with the reduced size of my prostate and I was able to go off the Finasteride. Now I take only the Saw Palmetto.  It enabled me to go many years without the need for other intervention, and hopefully I will go many more years without the need for Finasteride again.  However, I am thankful that the Finasteride was available when I needed it.  I would certainly recommend Saw Palmetto for your symptoms, but make sure BPH is all you have before starting it.","

"It only took several days to show initial signs of working.  After about 4-6 weeks, I was able to have comparatively excellent urinary flow and also found I wasn't waking up near as often with an urgency to urinate.  It has also helped reduce the amount of times going throughout the day due to my feeling of an empty bladder after going vs. before starting taking it where I never felt as though the bladder was truly empty, likely due to an almost non-existent stream .  I take a 100% pure saw palmetto liquid extract, standardized with over 93% fatty acids in a 320 mg. soft gel which is ordered online only as the one I use to purchase at the health food store had a large number of other ingredients including zinc.  I've noticed a far better effect using the online only available version with no other additives.  Give it some time to really start working.  I see on here that I'm not the only younger person taking this.  I always thought this affect those in their 60's or beyond but the more research I do, I see more and more people even in their 20's coming forward with issues.  I've had the problem since my early 20's and it went improperly diagnosed/untreated until just last year.  As of this writing I am 40.  Finally, relief.  If it's permitted, I use Prostate Rx from www.prostaterx.net.  I couldn't find that exact brand under the brand product used under optional information.  The brand that I use does -not- contain zinc or any other ingredients.  My brand contains -only- the saw palmetto liquid extract.

"Took 1 cap/day for 36 days. On 34th day headaches started, felt slightly nauseated, weak, and just didn't feel well.  During entire 36 days, no decrease in frequency of urination, day or night, no increase in the amount of urine per bathroom trip, and possibly a slight increase in the intensity of the urge to urinate.  But to be fair, I am not sure that my symptoms on days 34 to 36 were caused by the Saw Palmetto and not by some other cause.  After I recover, I am considering trying another brand of Saw Palmetto like the online product that Wil174 found to be very effective.","

The first is FoodScience of Vermont Saw palmetto and has consistently worked very well, reducing my trips to the BR from 3-4 times a night to none. The other was a Walgreens product that is no longer available. It was a small, round maroon liquid gel pill that worked just as well. 

Among the ones that have had no effect are Nature's Way extract, Nature's Bounty Saw Palmetto Complex, Now Foods saw Palmetto and some others I don't recall.

"I have taken Saw Palmetto for about 30 years on and off, mostly on. I have a very large prostate according to a diagnosis and very early- in my thirties- on I was urinating a lot and feeling discomfort around urination. When I took saw palmetto that changed, when I didn't take it, the frequent urination and discomfort returned. I have found that good quality saw palmetto makes a big difference- Whole Foods verses Rite Aid for example. Also the dose. When I take it twice a day the difference is more noticeable. The saw palmetto also can impact sexual stamina and comfort comfort. Its not an actual aphrodisiac but it does seem to increase arousal and duration. It isn't viagra or anything but I do feel it makes a difference. I read other reviews that said it didn't work at all and that doctors agree. I honestly think it had to do with the quality of the product and the dose. When I run out and buy some at a drug store or grocery store vitamin section, it really is entirely different. I suggest buying a good quality organic product - The Whole Foods Brand works better than some of the more expensive products at whole foods. Then gradually increase the dose per day until you notice a difference in the number of times you have to pee in a day and if it is uncomfortable and if you have a healthy stream. Once you find that dose that works for you, then maintain that dose for some weeks. Then stop and see if you don't notice a drastic difference. This is one of the best things I've done for my health in my life. ","

"Serrapeptase is truly a miracle.
I’m writing this comment for people with COPD/emphysema/asthma and all lung deceases. My mom is 65 and was diagnosed with COPD many years ago.
Her condition got worse every year; she has been in a hospital, used an oxygen mask and barely could function past years. For years, I’ve been searching for a natural cure but could not find anything helpful. This October 2011, I came across a site www.serrapeptase.com with a story about Serrapeptase ‘The Miracle Enzyme’.
I was sceptical in a beginning but decided to give a try and ordered a book called “Is Serrapeptase the Miracle Enzyme? “. I was impressed that there is an action plan of what to do including basic food plan and the supplements. My mom followed the recommended basic health plan, and took Serrappetase 80,000 3-4 caps 3 times daily plus CurcuminX4000. She had a lot of mucus coming out and some days were better some worse.
Now just 2 month later 12/29/2011 she’s able to breathe, function and not taking prednisone. Her blood pressure and blood sugar levels are normal and her doctor was impressed with her lung and overall conditions and blood test at last visit. If you interested you can order a book and products at http://www.goodhealthusa.com/.  You health in your hands!

Ibuprofen helped with the pain but finally someone recommended I take Serrapeptase which I had never heard of.  On the 4th day of taking Serrapeptase my sciatic problem completely disappeared and has not retutned for nearly 2 years.  I still find it incredible as I had tried every treatment I could learn about, including prolotherapy.  I have since recommended to 2 others with a similar condition and they both experienced a cure for their sciaticus though it took 5 days.

I searched the internet looking for information on this condition and I followed an obscure reference and discovered serrapeptase.  I studied everything I could find & then purchased a bottle locally .  I started taking 80M units on Thursday and on Monday the therapist was very surprised that my stubborn left forearm had finally lost a quarter inch & that was a first.  I mentioned the enzyme and she was surprised.  I have shared the enzyme with a friend who has had lymphedema since cancer surgery in 1989 and after two weeks on the enzyme, she didn't have to wear a compression sleeve for the first time in 22 years.  I will never stop taking serrapeptase because I know that my condition will raise it's ugly head if I do stop.  I have experienced no side effects at all, only benefits!","

"I started taking serrapeptase due to family history of heart disease.  I have high cholesterol and my doctor wants me to take one of the common prescriptions that cause liver damage so I opted not to go that route. 
I found this product (BlockBuster All Clear) and thought this is just what I needed!  After taking for a month, I discovered it was helping the arthritis pain in my hips!  I could not sleep at night because the weight of my body on my hips would keep me awake.  Then, it absolutely totally overcame fibromyalgia!  I am TOTALLY PAIN FREE.  If I miss taking it for more than 24 hours I feel the difference. 
  My husband was having difficulty with pain in his shoulder and back due to degenerative arthritis and a bad car accident.  He says the pain is much less,  and he can now play golf again. 
  I gave some to my Mom as she has 95% blockage in her carotid artery. She has had improvement! 
  I gave it to my Dad due to his heart disease, and it cleared up his sciatic pain. I realize not all supplements work for everyone, but this has worked for everyone I have given it to!  Just keep taking it for a period of time. 
  I think some people don't take it long enough to give it a chance to work. I take a supplement with serrapeptase AND nattokinase in it. ","

"Took it for artery health more than a year ago so do not know if it helped or not.Taking it again for same reason but also to see if will have any effect on eye floaters, known scars, and Peyronies' scar tissue. Had no negative effect last year but everyone has their own biology, some are allergic to peanuts for example. I have lived in Europe and it is commonly used there. I rated my experience one star only because I cannot see if there was any effect on my arteries or not. Blood tests indicate I have inflammation and I know I have eye floaters so I will take this product and see if that changes or not.  I hope so but everyone responds differently. I suspect some are not measuring their reactions properly. I have acid reflux, so my stomach is very sensitive, and Serrapeptase has yet to upset my stomach.  It surprised me when I read that people said they had diarrhea after use. The older you get the more susceptible to diarrhea you become in the best of times. On the other end of the spectrum one has to be cognizant of the Placebo Effect where you feel something positive is happening when it is not.  I will report in a few months my result of this experiment as objectively as I can.  I just started a new period of usage.  I last used it a year ago for 90 days.","

"For anyone having loose stools with Serrapeptase ---- you MAY be breaking down old fecal materials that have resided in your bowel for possibly years.  Many people in our world are now getting colon cancer at higher rates than ever in the history of mankind due to all the chemicals in our diets, the products we use to clean our bodies, even in makeup and soaps.  Our soil is depleted of necessary nutrients our grandparents enjoyed.  We are a fast food society and that adds up to a lot of processing for our livers, kidneys, bowels and hearts, plus pancreas and all the way to the brain.  Look how many people have dementia, diabetes, MS, Parkinson's, etc.  We are full of toxins.  Get them out with good brand name supplements, lower your inflammation from all these poisons, eat a clean diet and avoid grains, gluten and sugar at all costs.  Cheat a little, but use the Internet to research what you take in.  90 percent of disease starts in the dirty bowel, where small pockets start holding on to the waste, they expand over the years as our bowels age and backs up like a plugged toilet or sink.  The worst is when our brains start to suffer because then even what I am writing here makes little sense when you're in pain and can't think clearly due to ""brain fog.""  Prescription drugs contribute to the mess, and they only treat symptoms in most cases.  Let's learn what we can learn to heal ourselves, not just patch, patch, patch and we will have a much healthier old age!  I preach this to my patients who are mostly doctors, nurses and veterinarians who are not getting well using Western medicine.  Functional medicine and Eastern medicine like I'm trained in really do work most of the time. (Acupuncture, chiropractic and herbs.)  If you wait too long, it's hard to change the course of disease.

I had some gastric distress for the first few days, but that went away.  I quickly found that a back problem from an injury some 40 years ago almost completely vanished, and my chronically stuffed sinuses drained much easier.  I also no longer get tartar buildup on my teeth, only a crumbly white precursor that scrapes off easily.  Long-term allergies disappeared.  In fact, all markers of inflammation in my body vanished.  I had not even realized there WAS inflammation; this is just how I felt.  But I knew when it was gone; I felt much better overall.

As it happens, I also no longer experience any symptoms of cardiac insufficiency when I am at high elevations.  I consider the stuff to be amazing.","

 Slippery Elm works excellent! Much better than all the other things I've tried. I've stopped all prescription meds but this herb for my stomach pain. The prescription meds didn't relieve my gastritis pain and made me tired, achy and deficient in B12 and iron. This herb works MUCH better and has no side effects that I've seen.
 I make it into a paste and keep it in the fridge. I swallow a rounded teaspoon whenever I'm in pain and always before bed. I buy it by the pound from a Michigan herb store called Our4corners. A pound lasts me about 8 months and costs $20. The prescription PPI was $150 a month and the stomach-coating med Carafate was $50 a month, so you can see the cost savings is astronomical! 
 This herb has made my chronic gastritis bearable. It's nice having days where my pain is a 0/10 :) ","

"My mother has had chronic diarrhea for 4 years,she always had bowel problems but got worse after bowel resectioning.She had 3 colonoscopies & they found ulcers & inflammation,she had a round of antibiotics,,But the chronic diarrhea continued. I started giving her just 1 capsule of Slippery Elm Bark at night before bed,AWAY FROM 'all other medications'. IMPORTANT! 
SHE HAD IMMEDIATE RELIEF THE NEXT MORNING. It has been 2 months now,is not completely normal (yet) but she can get out & about without worrying.
Interestingly, if she forgets to take at night,diarrhea returns..
I love SEB and use it myself,it is in my ESSIAC TEA FORMULA that I use to shink my FIBROID TUMORS (benign) and it WORKS! I know because my surgeon who removed a large fibroid 11 years ago said he ""had never seen anything like it before"". ""It was gelatinous (jelly like) & was mostly scraped off"". You see it was dissolving! My friend had the same exact experience & remarks from her surgeon. That's ESSIAC TEA, an old Ojipway herbal remedy from Canada, Nurse Cassie (essiac) saw the results in curing of dis-ease and started using in Cancer Center where she worked.
Thanks","

"I was diagnosed with IBS some 20 years ago.  When it manifested itself as diarrhea, nothing was effective.  Then, a friend told me how an RN had suggested it after doctors had all but given up on his young son's life-threatening diarrhea.

As per the instructions she provided (1 Nature's Way brand per 100 lbs of body weight) I made a tea using 2 caplets.  I waited 12 hours before taking a 2nd cup, as per instructions (once every 12 hours until regular).  It tastes of maple, in my estimation and is easy on the taste buds.

For severe, cramping diarrhea I have found it is effective in 12 hours at producing a loose to fairly firm stool.  Cramping was greatly reduced to occasional pangs.  After a 2nd cuppa and another 24 hours, I was regular and pain free.

I have used it ever since and both my father and a good friend reported similar results.  Both are seniors in fair health, dad is diabetic.

Once I stopped taking alcohol, my IBS subsided almost completely with the odd flare up now and again.  Just the same, we always keep a bottle of Slippery Elm Bark handy. It usually provides noticeable relief in a matter of an hour or so.

I know other brands are reliable as well.  HOWEVER, I don't know how they measure up potency wise with Nature's Way--You may be confident in the 1 capsule per 100 lbs Rx with this brand as it is consistent in its strength.

My heartbeat was like Morse code, and had the tendency to stop for several seconds and start again, cca 20 hrs a day. I was told there was no medication for it. I found a german study online that treated older folks with taurine for the uneven beat and arginine to eliminate pauses. One year ago I started to take a rounded teaspoon of T and a flat teaspoon of A twice a day on an empty stomach, which was a lot less than used in the study. Within 3 weeks my heart was beating normally. Just recently I started to experiment with skipping every 3rd month, as is the recommendation for amino acids. Even during the month off my heart continued to beat normally.

"For jock itch this is very effective but may take several weeks before you have killed all infected sites.  There will be a mild cold\hot feeling in the treated skin for an hour after application. After first treating and area the infected skin will die but this is not painful.  It worked when all drug store sprays\lotions failed.  SIDE EFFECTS: 1st time use skin irritation (so test a smaller area first). Abdominal Pain, Diahrea, Headache, Nausea, Vertigo & Weakness is possible at higher purity and larger coverage.  I did experience this after using the 100% pure oil over a large area (inner legs & scrotum).  Side effects of toxic levels last hours.  Absorbion thought the skin will take hours before you feel it, so there are cautions I recommend.  1. Do not cover any large area with 100% pure oil. 2. Dilute to 5%-15% using oil (not Witch Hazel as it helps absorption. 30% using Witch Hazel on scrotum will result in the toxic side effects!).  Drinking Milk will slow absorption.  The oils effectiveness is in killing fungi/bacteria on surface and just below. Absorbtion into blood stream will result in nearly same side effects as ingestion (toxic).  Will I use the oil still.. yes.  I will however do more experimentation in the 5%-15% oil diluted on the scrotum.  Scrotal use may also reduce sperm production to near zero due to estrogen in the oils.  Not painful but ejaculation may look clear like baby oil. Caution scrotal use if you still want children.  ","

The minute two spots popped up I started putting the oil on and they went away in 3 days instead of 10.  It's like it stopped the process of the sores at that time so they didn't get painful, while healing them to go away. Also I applied the oil in all other tingling areas around my anus and vagina, and had absolutely no sores come up.  It has worked well for me!  I think the bad reviews are from people using diluted tea tree oil, that is mixed in with other ingredients, like IN shampoos or lotions. I would recommend asking the pharmacy to start ordering 100% Austrailian Tea Tree Oil, that's what I did and it cost me about $5 a bottle.  I've also used it to resolve my cracked heels, and keep them from returning.  ","

"Rosacea, skin and ocular.  Saw 3 eye doctors when I developed a red spidery blotch on one of my eyes. Tried all sorts of expensive eye drops and oral meds= no improvement. Finally found some great Australian sites w lots of info on using tto for demodex mites that are found in high numbers on anyone w rosacea. It's been a siege but the tto is a godsend and my ocular rosacea is nearly gone. While researchers haven't agreed on the causes for rosacea, no one disputes the link between demodex and rosacea. So keeping the demodex mites under control is critical to people w rosacea. Thankfully tto is inexpensive: trader Joe's carries pure oil, soap, shampoos, etc all at low prices. The Body Shop sells a WONDERFUL tto facial wash that has helped my skin to look better than it has in maybe 15 years. Surprising positive side effect is that my eyebrows and lashes are growing and my hair isn't falling out the way it was...since the mites live in the hair follicles and the tto kills the mites, I guess this allows the follicles to grow new hair. If you google hair loss and tto, you'll find a lot of info.   WARNING: tto is very toxic to pets so never touch them with it on your hands. They do make shampoos w tto for dogs but the tto is less than 1%. ","

"using straight tea-tree oil directly on the sores on my face has helped the swelling and reduced the redness, it stings but the pain from the tea tree oil is easier to deal with than the pain from the swelling. My face has broken out a lot this summer so I'm going to try using the oil as preventative after this heals up, nothing else has reduced the swelling as much as the TTO has, and it feels like it's healing much faster. Using a moist paper towel to soften, clean and cool the sores. TTO has many other uses and I highly recommend trying it out, if you do use it on your animals DO NOT use it in human concentrations, it's toxic to pets (and people) if ingested, and pets lick themselves a lot, so use no greater than a 1% concentration on your pets.

My husband had a skin infection on his knee at a post-surgical site... but many months after it had previously healed. We thought it might have been as result of a scratch or working out too much in the pool. We applied tea tree oil at 100% concentration - just 2 drops. Within just a couple of hours it appeared to be improving. We repeated this over the course of several days. In just a couple of days a scab had formed nicely. One week later he is completely fine. Happy to share some pictures. It appeared to have healed very quickly. ,"

"I put the tea tree oil in a glass eye dropper bottle and every day I added a drop or two around the nail and under the tip.  This was July 2016.  In July 2017 I was trimming my toe nails and noticed a seeping, sticky liquid near the top of my toe at the corner of my nail.  The skin around my toe nail was red and looked swollen. The next day, I soaked my toes in peroxide, and put some neosporin on the toe in all the areas that looked red.  Then my other big toe started up, no seeping, but red, and swollen.  A day or two after that they itched so bad I could barely sleep all night.  I kept soaking in peroxide morning and night and putting neosporin and a band-aide on both toes.  I went to the doctor and was prescribed an antibiodic.  The doctor took a sample of my nail and skin and sent it to the lab.  I have had toe nail fungus for 10 years.  It got so bad my nails were separating from the skin and the nails turned brown and black in places.  Really painful too when wearing shoes.  Anyway the antibiodic started to help my toe infection or whatever it was causing the pain and itching but I was allergic to the medicine after four days of use.  I quit the medication, and the toe infection came back.  I continued to soak in peroxide and use neosporin, and wrap toes in band-aides.  It cleared up.  And, the lab came back with NO toe nail fungus!  I was shocked even though my new nail growth is 3/4 of the way out and looks great.   1/4 which is the tip portion of the nail, is discolored and gross, but it's growing out.  I know the tea tree oil wiped out the fungus, no doubt.  I had tried at least 15 things to rid it and nothing worked.  I was not ready to take the leap and get lamisil and risk kidney damage and other bad side effects.  Anyway, now I'm hyper sensitive to tea tree oil.  After not using it for 2 weeks, I tried applying it, and my toes the next day burned & itched like crazy.  I tried again, same thing. I highly recommend Tea Tree oil, but watch for irritation.","

I washed my face with cold water hoping to calm down my skin, it is now around 4:30pm and nothing has really happened yet.

Sometimes when the pleurisy gets really bad (b/c my antifungal regimen will be too weak), I'll grab a q-tip, soak it in tea tree, and insert into my nostrils. Within seconds the burning pain will be gone. It's unreal. For example, I've had horrible pleurisy pains for the past few days. I took my regular antifungals, peppermint (which sometimes helps; also helps asthma), and even aspirin! Nothing helped! So finally, I tried this method because it feels like I'm breathing fire and I was desperate. I know you're not supposed to have skin contact but it truly helps the pain.

"Had athletes foot since I was in junior high school. Tried everything under the sun from doctor prescribed remedies to over the counter creams, sprays, and ointments. Some helped with temporary relieve anywhere from an hour to a couple days, but ""nothing"" ever relieved totally or stopped it! ""Nothing""! Got worse over the years with times the itching was SO bad I would literally rub/scratch the bottoms of my feet bloody and raw. At times my feet would literally burn like they were on fire. When in the military it got worse due to constant marching, laced up boots, and not always being able to clean/wash them properly. Sometimes for days at a time. And stinky feet!?! I could clear a gymnasium in minutes! I would ""never"" take my shoes or boots off in public or someones home. If that was a requirement, I simply made an excuse and didn't go in! Embarrassing doesn't even ""begin"" to describe things. 

One night while staying at my mothers house the itching & burning was soooo bad, to the point of tears, I rubbed my feet bloody and couldn't sleep. She had a bottle that only said Tea Tree Oil for Skin Relief on the label (mixed with some lotion, have no idea what). I don't know the name of it or the percentage of TTO, but I was desperate to try anything at that point. I saturated both feet from my ankles down and put fresh cotton socks on because my feet were a bit oily afterwards. Didn't want to stain the sheets or cover. The itching stopped within minutes and I finally got a good nights sleep! Next morning I took the socks off and was ""shocked"" they were full of dead moist skin! I pealed more skin off in sheets, including thick crusty heel skin! My feet were a bit tender for a couple days, BUT THE FRICKIN' FUNGUS WAS GONE, DEAD!!! First itch, burn, pain free experience in over 40 years!!! I'd forgotten what it was like to walk pain free and not think about my feet all day. And no more stinky feet! Finally Cured! Soft skin too!

"A 32 year old previously healthy male committed suicide after taking this supplement. He had no history of mental illness but developed a few months of aggression followed in the last month by insomnia, audio and visual disturbances, and suicidal ideation.  He was baffled and tormented by his symptoms and sought help.  Everyone who knew him thought he must have been poisoned or had a brain tumor. After his death it was discovered that he had been taking tribulus. There is an alarming similarity between adverse effects/symptoms reported on workout threads and his symptoms.  There is actually a medical publication reporting a psychotic break in a 30 year old male that subsided once he discontinued tribulus.  Most threads report anecdotal/personal experience of feeling paranoid, suicidal, angry, and unable to sleep that subsided quickly once tribulus was discontinued. A few mentioned mild pre-existing anxiety that was heightened and led to suicidal ideation while on tribulus.  PLEASE DISCONTINUE USE IF TRIBULUS HAS THIS EFFECT ON YOU. An FDA report on this death has been made.","

"This seemed to either cause or exacerbate some really bad delusions that also contributed to me taking way too much of this herb afterward, and may have contributed to severe euporic mania (not the hyper sort; I was relaxed) and depression (whereas it was minor before by comparison), as well as some strange Tourette's type motion-based tics. I'm kind of OCD. So, the obsessions I have mingled with the delusions. It made things difficult. They weren't fixed obsessions, but ones that shifted, although they would generally recur within a few minutes to months. They were very intelligent obsessions that gained personality in my manic phase.

Valerian did relax me when first taking it. However, either over time or when I stopped taking it (not sure which), I got like panic attacks with bad delusions. Never had those before. This may be related to another herb that the delusion convinced me to take, though.

I don't know for sure if valerian was the cause, but that was the first and only part of my life where I took it. I'm not on any medications, and have never been on anything for a mental illness.

It may have also just have been me going extra crazy for some unknown reason, but that's never happened before.

I used Naturalist brand Valerian root. My sister and Mother use it and love the stuff. They have no problems with it.

My side effects (if that's what they were) lasted a long time. I got nightmares and stuff, too. They were incredibly dreadful. I had nightmares before this, but not as bad. My intrusive thoughts got worse. To help keep nightmares away, If listen to church music while I slept, sleep with the light on our such. Turning the fan on May have helped.

Another side effect seemed to be something kind of like sleep paralysis, if that's not what it was. I've actually heard that can be a valerian side-effect, though. The other stuff I've mentioned is new as far as my research has found.

This was like a side effect worse than death.","

I did not get tired the first day but the second day I took it in the morning for stiffness and I could not stay awake most of the day. It does smell. It does work well. I would recommend it more for sleep than stiffness but it does both. I would guess its about 70% sleep aid and 30% tension reliever.,"

We have tried every thing, changing eating habits, getting more outside playtime, etc. The valerian root I bout was from the local Health food store and designed for children. We did two droppers each night (6ml) and it worked like a dream. However, my son has started having headaches and is not sleeping through the night anymore. We have used it about 8-10 weeks, which I realize now is too long. I believe he is experiencing the side effects, so I recommend this be a temporary remedy.

"I have had life long insomnia, and try to avoid taking prescription sleeping pills as the dosage needed to be effective leaves me groggy during the day. Valerian extract taken every night has helped me immensely. It does not knock me out, but instead gives me the feeling that my body is getting sleepy and calm naturally, and allows me to fall asleep with ease. If I get up in the night to use the bathroom I can fall asleep quite easily again. I also find it easy to wake up and feel refreshed in the morning. I have taken these in tablet form on and off for two years now, and find that even if I go a few days without use, I still get the same effect, whereas my nan tried these once and because it takes time to be effective, it didn't help her so she hasn't tried since. Give it two weeks and you will feel much more relaxed at night, which will at least help cut the dosage of prescription pills needed to fall asleep. Remember, it is not a knock out pill, you still have to be in the right head-space to sleep, it is not a short cut to overcoming caffeine or other stimulation!","

"I have been taking vitamin shoppe Valarian root extract. Brief history. All
My problems started when I dropped weight ( don't be jealous), flat couldn't sleep and felt like I had the flu all
Day. After over a year and 5 Dr's thinking I was a quack they finally found out my adrenal glad wasn't working. Got that fixed and felt great but the ""falling and staying asleep' never corrected itself fully. I have to take an ambien and most often a Xanax at night. Started taking the valarien root and after 2 weeks I was mad I thought I wasted my money until about week 3 to 4 noticed I went 5 hours without waking up. I was stunned. Now let me be clear that it did nothing for me to help fall asleep but has made a hug difference in staying asleep longer and better quality of sleep. Still have to take ambien but every other night I half the ambien dose. I always want to be clear that I tried melatonin and it caused beyond horrible nite mares so I threw them away after 3 nights of that mistake. I also take vitamin C and D with no magnesium stelate in it. 
It will not make u pass out like drugs but if u hang in there a month u will gradually notice your sleep quality get better. Don't miss doses. No side affects from missing it , u just have to start over for your bodies to get used to it again. Good luck! I am on my 3 rd bottle and won't leave home without it. ","

Sometimes, felt nervous inside, so would do 100  jumping jacks to try to tire myself out and go back to sleep, as I had to rise at 6 am for work.  This went on for about a year.

"I buy the root in bulk and make my own medicines from it.  ""Ease of Use"" gets -1 stat simply due to the old sock smell.  I make a highly concentrated syrup with this and skullcap.  One thing I've learned is valerian is great for putting you to sleep, but bad at keeping you asleep.  That's where skullcap comes in.
Valerian does have a chance to not work or even backfire, keeping you awake, based on several points.  This is why I always mix it with other sedative/calming herbs; usually skullcap, sometimes hops, passion flower, lemonbalm, or catnip.  This lessens the chance of it not working.
Also, valerian tea is amazing for muscle cramps/pain topically.","

You will get a good nights sleep :)","

"I use a 450 mg Valerian root/ Passion flower combination capsule. The smell is awfule. I open the capsule and mix the powder with my nightly sleepytime tea which is a sweet, aromatic caffeine free chamo,ile and spearmint tea that masks the awful taste and smell of the Valerian root. I sleep like a baby now. Yes, I do wake up for potty breaks, but fall right back to sleep. I don't have that terrible grogginess the next day from sleeping pills. The best part is it helps to control my seizures too. I ran out of my sz pills for a couple days but was ok because I had the extra boost from the Valerian root to help me get by. The only headaches I get now are from seasonal allergies, not from migraines. Except for the smell and taste, which I have been able to mask with the sleepytime tea, I would say the Malarian root is a great product to have in your medicine cabinet. It has definitely worked for me.","

I have now been using Valerian (2,000) on a regular basis and found it to be reasonably effective. They are not very powerful and only assist in relaxing me, therefore promoting a better chance to a good night sleep. I therefore fin Valerian to be a reasonably good supplement for mild insomnia and also for reducing the level of anxiety. ","

One benefit is that it doesn't leave me with the hangover that many of the other sleep aids do.

"I am on my second bottle of Dried Valerian Root Extract (very concentrated) and I use an alcohol-free tincture. I have been using it over a month. It is very effective, I use it primarily to calm anxiety and drink 30 drops diluted into a beverage a couple times during the day. I am a very manic person and if I drink enough, it can make me sleepy, but usually I just find it calming and do use during the daytime as well as before bed to sleep better. The only complaint- the smell. In a strong beverage, you cannot taste it, however the smell is not pleasant. I do find the effects beneficial enough to look past this. But I would not call it palatable and would certainly dilute it in a strong flavored beverage if using an extract/tincture. 5 Stars for me, I love all natural, fast acting, long lasting relief from Valerian root for my anxiety and mania and fast paced thoughts.","

Sometimes I take this for a few days to a week in a row but not longer. Sometimes I take it with alcohol. I find it effective in reducing or eliminating mild anxiety or stress and reducing moderate anxiety making it tolerable. More serious stress or anxiety usually requires a stronger (Rx) med.

I had body aches, and I am still dealing with the stomach pain, reflux, and bloating that this has caused.  It also increased my anxiety and nervousness almost to the point of panic.

"This comment is for Mady. I think your doctor wants you to either take the 50,000 units weekly or the 400 units, daily.  You don't have to take both.  Start with the prescribed dose. You are usually only prescribed for a short time period.  If it's too much, or you don't feel good on it, cut back to the 400 units daily.  I am increasing my dose to 800 units slowly.  It has a nice side effect of lifting my mood.  Buy a good brand of over the counter D3.  Make sure your get the D3 and the other forms of D are synthetic. Susan","

This has been a great addition to my treatment with the only side effect after 5 weeks is having more energy and finally sleeping better; my memory has improved and I have more strength to actually get up and do things again. Even my grown children have noticed a difference in my stamina and mood levels. My work has improved and I smile so much more because I feel so much better. I thought my thyroid radiation treatment 18 months ago had not been successful because all the symptoms were still with me. Turns out they were related to the vitamin d deficiency as well.

I had a little bit of nausea after 10 hrs., but this is something I have had before and can't really say it was due to the Vitamin D.  I took some Maalox Total and was fine shortly thereafter.  I will update my progress for others that may be hesitant to take this dosage around the middle to late September.  I will share my experience with this dosage over those 7-8 weeks and my lab results to see how much my number increases.  

I finally decided to take the vitamin D because I have been suffering for the last 2 1/2 years with joint soreness, fatigue and just a general feeling of having the flu.  Blood tests were not showing anything conclusive and my new doctor ran the D test after I told her a rheumatologist I went to never ran the test.  Is this the cause of my symptoms? I won't know until I am done with the D therapy, but again I will update later next month in case there is anyone else that may be having similar symptoms.  ","

"I am 24 yr post gastric bypass patient and have a level of 8 Vit D and dr prescribed 50,000 3X's a wk for 3 mons.  I have had alot of side effects from it...after taking the 2nd dose had stomach probs/nausea/GI probs by the 3rd dose I had heart palps, high blood pressure (which is always low), and aniexity so bad and chest pain.  Also have experienced increased urination.  Told my dr and she said this is the 1st she has heard of anyone having these type of symptoms....so I tried it again and it happened all over again. This went on for the 2 mons I of trying to take it.  I am not taking that large a dose ever again.  I have bought a liquid Vit D3 1000mg (Wellese - Good Brand) and I am going to take it every couple days and gradually build up.  Well have my labs redone and see..it never went up that much in the first place.  I also suffer from fibromyaglia, myofacial pain, chronic headaches, anemia/low iron and calcium, vertigo, thyroid, heart palps/irreg beats and anixiety/depression (I wonder why?) So maybe it has something to do with all the conditions but I was told that it would help them all and that is not the case.  I feel worse when I take it and gives me more flare ups.  Comments on here have helped me to know I am not alone and others were have side effects too - Thanks

"Here is an update to my 8/11/09 post - I have taken four pills so far and haven't noticed any problems.  The only reason I rated the ""Effectiveness"" section with 2 stars was due to the fact that I haven't completed treatment yet. I haven't noticed any changes with my symptoms, but I'm not sure if my symptoms are due to the D deficiency and I'm only half way through the prescription I was given.  I know many people are hesitant to take 50,000iu (as I was and to be truthful it still gives me pause every time I take it) and I wanted to share my experience with others who are deficient. 

From all the research I have gathered over the last several weeks of reading up on the subject of D deficiency - this is something people shouldn't take lightly.  The medical community have finally realized that D deficiency leads to a whole host of medical problems.  Vitamin D can not only provide treatment for some conditions, but actually prevent others from occurring in the first place.  I couldn't deny the facts and knew I had to take this or possibly deal with greater problems in the future as a result of depriving my body of something it vitally needs.  

One other point I wanted to mention for others who might be going through the same experience I am and that's Vitamin D deficiency and an underactive thyroid.  The information on a possible connection  between the two conditions on medical sites have been sketchy - it's alluded to in some writings, but nothing concrete is documented.  Maybe it's wishful thinking on my part that the D deficiency is the cause for the thyroid problem, but only time will tell.  My thyroid is a little underactive, but yet my thyroid antibodies test is negative for hypothyroidism.  So, again, maybe there isn't a link between the two conditions. 

I will give another update if anything new happens, if not, I will give a final entry at the end of October when I go for another set of blood tests to see if the D has increased my numbers.","

"I had multiple problems that had gone on for about 10 years.  Problems included: severe fatigue, muscle pain, severe joint swelling and pain, bone pain, ""foggy"" feeling, sinus problems, ear problems, a positive ANA test result and breathing problems.  I've tried multiple treatments through several doctors and specialists.  Switched to a new doctor and - during intake - found low Vitamin D levels.  Doctor prescribed 100,000 IU's to be taken one time each week for four weeks (to be retested following).  Initially, I experienced an increase in pain, almost like a tenderness all over my body.  However, the joint swelling, pain, sinus, and several other problems have subsided and the tenderness is getting better.  It wasn't overnight, but I am getting better.

I would highly recommend this treatment.  I know some of the prescribed levels sound scary, but it has helped me to finally experience relief after 10 years of pain...and the level I am taking is short term.  Please stay at it as best you can, I experienced relief from my symptoms and I believe that you can as well, but you'll need to stick with it.

As an aside, my doc says if my numbers check okay at the end of treatment, then I'll move to a 1,000 IU daily supplement.

My best to you!","

"I have fibromyalgia; hypothyroidism and recently started seeing a endrcrinologist instead of just my family doctor. Both of these symptoms triggered him to check my Vit D which was at 20 and he says low for me s/b 50. He explained the two natural sources are fish/oil and sunshine - neither of which I get a lot of; and the things you would get it from otherwise supplemental is milk, some Oj, etc. I don't use alot either. So he put me on 50,000IU per wk for 12wks retest at that time, I am 5weeks into this and every week I have HURT MORE with my FIbro , my thyroid seems to be enlarged and I can barely hold my head up most days I am so sleepy!!  I had no clue it was the Vit D making me this way til I read all your posts THANK YOU for posting!!  I am calling the endro. on Monday to see if this normal while getting my levels back to normal or what..if it is I guess I will tough it out but man it is hard, and I cannot focus or remember anything. FYI to those of you mentioning you live in Sunny areas - doctor told me that dark skinned folks have a harder time absorbing Vit D from sun -which I am. AND you have to actually be out in the Sun in the evening between certain hours to actually obtain the VIT D to a meaningful level.  Anywho if I stick w/ this after talking to him, after 12wks he wants me on 2,000 IUs a day.

"Diagnosed 18 years ago with chronic major depression. Have been taking Rx for 18 years and it DID save my life. Got better, but still never really felt 100% at any time over the years.

I read about Vit D3 deficiency (http://www.vitamindcouncil.org) and got tested (using the correct test (25-hydroxyvitamin D test, also called a 25(OH)D ) . I was woefully deficient (28). Need to be in the 50-80 range, so started with the 2,000 IU/day and then found the 5,000 IU pill at iHerb.com (FYI: use DAH122 for $5.00 off your first order - my gift to you, :)  ) 

Since taking the Vit D3, my mood has dramatically improved - to the point that I am NOT taking any pharmaceutical Rx for depression for the first time in 18 years! I am truly amazed. Also, my overall health is better, my 'bad' cholesterol levels are dropping, no colds - not even the sniffles - since taking Vit D3. I've LOST approx. 25 pounds (read this may be due to NOT TAKING the anti-depressant). 

I will continue to take Vit D3 until I die. Absolutely remarkable results! Living in MN coupled with Scandinavian heritage, this vitamin is a MUST. I would recommend you get your Vit D3 levels checked.. and remember, if the lab you Dr. uses is Quest, then you have to multiply your results by 1.3 to get a more accurate result. Quest Labs have 'issues' and  yes, you can Google it for yourself. And don't listen to those that say a range of 30-40 is 'normal' and 'fine'. READ the results of the clinical RESEARCH, even if it is lengthy and technical.. Please don't be swayed by the pharmaceutical companies (and the FDA's)disinformation.  Take charge of YOUR life and do the research! You'll be glad you did.

The brand I use is not listed (Healthy Origins), so I just picked one.

"It has been interesting to read the blogs. I had my thyroid removed 3 years ago. I have periods of aches and arthritis like pain. Recently I have been experiencing pain in my rt. ankle and rt. wrist. Could not figure out why. My Dr. drew a level of vitamin d mine was 17! Started me on a 12 week dose of it 50,000 once a week. I have only taken 1 dose so far 5 days ago. Have noticed I have been aching more and more sleepy. Previous blogger said her dr. said it is normal since your muscles are adjusting to the dose. I hope she is right. I hope I feel better and losing some wt. would be a bonus. I'll write later to let you all know how it is working. Too early to tell. ","

"I'm 39 yrs old with sickle cell disease.After repeated requests, finally got a Vit. D level done which was extremely low(16).Now wondering if this is responsible for my chronic bone pain, vertebral fractures,hip degeneration(had hip replacement).Exactly 24hrs after 1st dose(50,000IU), had acute onset of full body pain, with mid lower back pain,elevated blood pressures,severe headache,and eventually had to go to E.R for pain control. I think it triggered a sickle cell crisis by day#2, after a 2nd dose(50,000IU).Pain lasted for a week. After 10days,I felt great,even better than my 'norm'.At first, my doc doubted the Vit D. caused this flare,(but it stressed my system, and stress causes sickle flares, so I tried again on day#11, with a worse sickle flare.I was hospitalized with full body pain, especially in lower mid back(rare spot for me)and mid chest, with associated acid reflux. Also had previous symptoms-high blood pressure, headaches and extreme fatigue.Still recovering.All docs denied knowing about any side effects of Vit.D, so I was just discharged and given Rx for 1,000IU capsules. I was planning on starting these today, when I did a search and easily found these reviews.Good to know it is not in my head!Not sure what to do now though.I dont mind struggling through the other side effects, but if it triggers a sickle cell crisis,this is dangerous, and life threatening.Right now just trying to get better from my recent back to back sickle episodes.

"I have RA, Type 1 Diabetes, Depression and now low levels of Vit D. Dr. prescribed me 50,000 once a week for 12wks to have levels rechecked. First week was ok, but I had some muscle twitching. Second week I felt a bit amped up and chalked it up to anxiety. Now at week 5 and I feel like my heart rate is elevated, pulse and bp have both been up, my blood sugars are roller coastering and I feel like I am on the edge of a panic attack all the time. I can't even look at anything with caffine, without feeling like my heart is gonna beat out of my chest. Plus sleep difficulties, etc. I called my Dr's office and was told that vitamin D would not be causing this unless my calcium levels were elevated. They weren't before I started, would the really increase that much? I'm not liking this at all. I'm not gonna take it anymore. Requested Rx for a smaller dose and was told ""No, just keep taking it, something else is going on."". I have had panic attacks prior to this and anxiety, but I run a nice level pulse and BP all the time. My blood sugar is also well regulated, well was. This week has been a nightmare of Highs and Lows. Anything I should tell the Doc to convince him I'm not crazy?","

"For those having generalized bone and muscle pain, cheer up. I had severe twinges of pain at the sites of past injuries to bones, and various wound scars. The older the wound site, the less the pain. However, pain and sometimes itching at the site of newer scars was often intense. These side effects have recently vanished, two months into my self-therapy of 5000IU daily. Also. my usual troubles with winter blues are gone, skin tone and general health have improved, and the old colon has gone into a lumberjack mode not seen since my 20's. I'm a middle-aged male, in recovery from Legionnaire's. The infection was severe, with numerous vile complications, all of which were nearly fatal. Recovery has been slow. But, this cheap D3 supplement is even helping fight pre-diabetic symptoms following my illness. The clinician following up with my case has been totally against any supplement except for a multivitamin. She knows nothing about vitamin D. All I get from her are lectures about diet and exercise, because she feels that diabetes is inescapably genetic, and that's that. When this 100-dose bottle is done, I'll get a test for 25(OH)D from the internet, then adjust accordingly. ","

Thought it was from using the computer. Pain got so ""severe"" that I started looking for answers on WebMD. Picked up a clue that it could be the vitamin D.  Stopped taking it 3 days ago and have finally had 3 good nights of sleep.  Arms still hurt, but feel more sore than the pain I was experiencing.  Also affected my bladder, kidneys, whatever.  That also is improving. Also experienced lot of tiredness, but figured it was lack of sleep. All this didn't start until about the 5th mo. of taking vitamin D.  After my arms and bladder are back to normal, I will try taking Vitamin D again, but only 1 a week to start.  I'm 67 and live in MI.","

The doctor put me on a 50,000 iu for a short time...and then I started taking the over the counter doses...I am now taking 5,000 iu a day...and my pain is so much better...I have done quite a bit of research on Vitamin D...and low Vitamin D can cause all sorts of other illnesses as well...I encourage everyone to do your own research on Vitamin D and how important it is for you....

I tell everyone I talk to about how important Vitamin D is....and I will continue to do so...I am living proof that Vitamin D is important....I have now seen liquid Vitamin D...so if you are having problems taking the soft gel...perhaps try the liquid D....and as with every thing else....this takes time and effort so that you can ""feel"" a difference....

" have felt ill since beginning treatment with 50,000 i.u D2 weekly. Have taken 7 of 12 pills. I began taking calcitonin-salmon nasal spray at the same time, left this off off to see if that would help: it did not. My D level was quite low. But I wonder if I could use D3 in pill form daily instead. 3,000 i.u daily? I read that this is a safe dose. Is it effective? I'm not comfortable continuing with huge weekly dose.","

"I was diagnosed with Fibro about 15 years ago, after treatments of different types and just accepting it, I began to have severe back pain and I have had 2 back, surgeries, the first 2005 was unsuccessful because I had the bones of an 80 year old lady, osteoporosis and three years ago they discovered that my vitamin D3 level was non existant and total was about a 9 and my Parathyroid hormone level was high I am on 50,000 iu everyother day and it still hovers at around 28 or so. My calcium level
is 10.1 and now they believe it could be primary, not secondary. My Gastro doc. thinks primary and my endocrinologist says maybe, he isn't positive. The other side to all of this is that I also have untreated sleep apnea I stop breathing 39 times per hour. I endocrinologist says that if my boby suddenly begins to retain the vit D that we are in for some real trouble so he watches me very close. I have to have labs done every 6 weeks. I have had 4 vertebrae
fused together and facing another surgery.
Anyway, my point is this I have been on RX strength for three years and haven't felt any benefit, but, when I don't take it my
parathyroid hormone levels go way up causing more bone loss. I have been tested
for malasorption and everything else.
There are days that it takes all I have to get up and go to work., and may I add that I am 47yrs.old and an early childhood educator (VPK) and Asst. Director at the christian school. I have degenerative bone disease and osteoarthritis I see three specialist. If I can work sometimes 50+ hours a week I know that others can too.
And they should, because the more active you are the better. Don't wollow in self pity. It is a sign of weakness.","

Also I have read that you must take magnesium and zinc which are co-factors for D3. You will feel bad if you don't take magnesium on a daily basis.
I just started this treatment less than a month, so I will see how I am doing in 3 months when we do labs again. Also anemia causes joint pain.","

I had breathing problems, couldn't climb stairs or walk more than 200 m.was on pain killers.
Dr sent me for a stress test & that was normal except I was like a fish out of water by 8 mins.
Then after many weeks I went to see a consultant for my tendonites & she asked if I ever had my vitamin D tested.
So it was done & it was a low 18 nmol or 7 ng.
Dr puts me on 800iu of D3. I ask for more but am told that it's the maximum & that's that.I did my google & got some D3 on the Internet. Did my calculations and  I require 7800 iu for 60 days.it's been 10 days & feel 10% better.
Doctors are good but some are old school & don't keep up with new and latest research.shame!

"Saw Dr because I was feeling much bone pain,  very weak, no energy, loss of interest in everything because of pain. Blood workup showed no R/A, no lupus, but low Vitamin D -- 22.  Started 1,000/day D.  2 months later, count was at 24.  Started 2,000/day.  2 months later 26.  Then script 50,000/week.  2 months later, some symptoms have lessened, but count at 32.  Dr happy with that ""it's within normal range"", she says.  I say - I want to see it at 65, mid-range.  She seems unconcerned.  In the meantime, I realize after some research, vitamin d is a fat-soluable vitamin and is best absorbed taken with fat.  So I now take it with a lunch or dinner meal, not with my a.m. toast and fruit.  Told dr about that - ""I don't know that much about vitamins...""  Time for new doctor.  Oh, she says I'm depressed - I tell her yes, this 6 months of non-stop pain is making me so.  No, I do not want to take meds for depression.","

"Hello all,

After reading all your posts some people need to do a bit more research on Vitamin D dosage. There are 2 types of Vitamin D in the body. Vitamin D2 is created by the body and then gets transformed to Vitamin D3. Thi 50,000 IU of Vitamin D is Vitamin D2. This creates a high level of Vitamin D2 but gets slowly converted to D3. Vitamin D3 is what the body uses and no Doctor would ever give someone 50,000 IU of Vitamin D3. It takes months of a high level of Vitamin D3 intake to create toxic levels. So rest assured the 50,000 IU of Vitamin D2 is safe. I am being treated with 50,000 IU because I have had muscle spasm and bone pain for 8 years after I was finally diagnosed with Vitamin D Deficiency (20) I have to take it once a week and have only been doing so for 1 weeek. I did notice some severe muscle twitching, but it was in the areas that I have severe muscle spasm (trigger points). Twitching to me indicates that the D is working because the muscles are reacting to something foreign to them. Also, with any treatment, one should always give the treatment at least a month before discontinuing. We must remember that our bodies are lacking something that it needs and when our bodies get ""used"" to not having this, it will react as if it is a foreign substance and eventually our bodies will get used to the higher amount. I only gave three stars because I have just started the treatement. I will update after the treatment has completed.","

Been feeling little depressed lately, little bit more irritable, can't sleep well, and feel muscle and joint pains.  My doctor didn't want to prescribe Vit D2/50,000 IU since I had a kidney stone problem in the past & I'm still under a care of a urologist.  She prescribed Vit D3/2,000 IU daily and sun exposure (good thing we're going to Hawaii in 2 wks).  Thanks for everyone's past reviews.  I'll update mine when I start taking the supplements.  Hopefully, the treatment will help boost my 9 ng/mL & gives minor to no negative side effects.","

"About three weeks ago (mid-May 2011), I was prescribed Vitamin D3 through my proctologist. I have been experiencing severe hemorrhoids since September 2010, along with pruritus ani. I had infrared cauterizations and I still was not getting better. A different doctor stepped in and knew immediately that I was not only suffering from irritable bowel syndrome, but also Vitamin D deficiency. He told me to take 3000 IU's a day for a month, and at the follow-up appointment, check for progress. He also told me to use Psyllium Husk 3 times daily for the IBS. This combination has worked very well for me. My hemorrhoids and pruritus ani are healing steadily, and the IBS is greatly diminished, if not cured. My tract is being de-toxified and cleaned up very effectively. I have noticed other benefits as well. I have had stress and, at times, panic-like anxiety off and on for the last 6 years, and I truly believe I have had a psychological boost since starting this regimen. I have never taken any anti-anxiety, anti-depression, or other mood stabilizing medications, only consulting with a psychologist for a year up to October 2010. My mind seems sharper, I am more of my natural ""self,"" being outgoing and energetic, and I have more physical energy from the morning through the evening. I have been able to concentrate on positive and productive thinking, instead of overwhelming fear and other negativity. I am going to report these other effects on my next visit in late June. I feel rejuvenated. I highly recommend the use of Vitamin D.      ","

"I had low vitamin D levels and low cortisol levels (low vit d causes low cortisol levels).  I was so fatigued and I hurt all over to the bone many days.  Ater just 2-3 weeks of taking 50,000 IUs of vit D active form my bones and joints stopped hurting.  I can't tell you how much better I feel and I also stopped having headaches.  After 6 weeks my weakness has begun to subside and I feel like I can finally start and exercise program.  I could not walk long distances for even 5 minutes before and I could not carry heavy things. I had no stamina. I can finally carry my heavy school books to my car again and walk all the way to the parking garage 5 minutes away without stopping to rest after 8 weeks.  I am to see the doctor again to recheck levels next week and to begin on the smaller doses of D3 (cholecalciferol). I am so thankful for Vitamin D 3.   ","

Now my symptoms are so mild I rarely notice them at all.  This has made a world of difference in my life and made it possible to have a life.  I take nothing else for my MS besides the vit D. Before vit D, I had days when I didn't know my name and other days when I couldn't get out of bed because I was dizzy.

"I am on my second dose of 50,000 units of Vit D taken once per week for 8 weeks.  I am supposed to take 1500 mg calcium and 2000 mg Vit D supplements also. I bought the petite Caltrate Citrate + D3 calcium (can be taken with or without food) and a high potency Vit D3 1000 mg per pill. I have been afraid to take the extra calcium and Vit D until I am done with the 50,000 mg. It just seems to be a large amount.  I go to an endocrinologist, and she faithfully tests my Vit D levels. When I first went to her she tested my thyroid because I was exhausted all the time and have body pains. My thyroid was l-o-w and am now on a 50 mg pill a day for that. I have hypothyroid (according to others I've talked to, this is not unusual as you get older). Due to this, my doctor started testing my calcium and Vit D. I can remember my mom telling me that I had rickets when I was a baby and would not walk. I do not know what the treatment was at that time, but I do know she took me to the doctor. My doctor was not surprised to hear this news since I have low calcium and Vit D. My energy level increased due to the thyroid treatment. I am hoping when this calcium and Vit D gets to working, my body will be pain free. I have never had any problems taking the high dose of 50,000 mg and faithfully take it once a week until it will be gone (I have great faith in my doctor). Then I will faithfully take the others daily and be retested again. I even double checked with the office girl about this and she called me back and said I was to take the daily supplements in between the 50,000 doses. I still think I know my body and am waiting until I take the last large dose before taking the dailies.  Hope this helps!","

"Have been exhausted and depressed for about 6 months. Dr. took blood panel & didn’t even mention my vitamin D score @ 15. When I researched it on my own I asked for the recommended 50,000 iu (D2) once a week for 8 wks. She said “I’ve been a dr. for 30 some years & vitamins are at the bottom rung of things that can be wrong with you.” She advised seeing a psychiatrist.

I gave her the name of Michael Holick MD, a pioneer in vitamin D research who has written a book, & also the site of the National Vitgamin D Council. At 9:00 am the very next day she called in the script. She had no clue about the importance of D or how to assess the numbers from the test. Apparently she did the research I had requested- thank God.

A tip for not having side effects with the high D dosage- take it with a large, fatty meal. It’s a perfect excuse to cheat & have fried foods or lots of butter without guilt. I have had no side effects by doing this (I think I read it on Cleveland Clinic or Dr. Holick’s site). Not through my regimen yet but am feeling brighter with more energy.

Just like educating my Dr., I plan to spread the word to everyone I know about the importance of D deficiency and how it also eventually leads to other serious illnesses. I live in Ohio & heaven knows we don’t get sun for a large part of the year. I am also fair skinned, so slather on the sunscreen in the summer. My body probably could never produce enough D on its own with these circumstances.

One dr. who has done many studies is calling D defiency an epidemic in this country, and unfortunately most doctors haven’t heard anything about it. It’s up to us to educate them!

I wish you all well, Ceci

"I don't take any medicines or other supplements at all. Vitamin D supplement still make me dry eye and dry mouth.  I am 50.

It is about a year ago, my doctor said my D level is only 10.xx. I still can not handle D supplement in low does after that extreme dry mouth and eyes experience at 2 months ago.

Here is what happened to me in the past 1 year. 

1. No problem when I start took 50,000 iu once a week for few weeks. Its is D3 from fish with doctor's prescription.

2. Over energy when I took it few times a week. So, doctor want me take 2000 iu daily. But, I only took 1000iu two or three times a week. 

3. Maybe dry eye (not dry mouth yet) start when I took 1000iu every other day. I know I have dry eye issue because all new contact lens cause my eye dry. But, this maybe because I am almost 50, so dry eyes is very normal in my age when I wear contact lens. 

4. Check D level again, only 25. So, doctor still wants me to take up to 2000 iu per day.

5. I start experience extreme dry eye and dry mouth after had took 1800 iu or 15000iu per day. By the way, I also start took Calcium with D at that time.

6. Finally, I called doctor, and stop taking any D and Cal supplements. 

7. After stop it for few days, no extreme dry issue anymore, but still feel dry eyes, and still not dare to wear contact lens.

8. After stop a month, I feel much better, but still dry eyes (not extreme). Check D level again, it drop back to 10.50.

9. I try on very low does D once a while, all caused my extreme dry. D 400iu supplement, a cup of milk with D, or a cup of almond milk with D for few days.

Now, I decide stop any food or drink with D supplement at least 3 months. I am not sure what I am going to next.

After my unpleasant D experience, I start vitamin supplement searching, I found a lot of supplement also contains herbs. I also found 1 of my Cal + D supplement does contains a herb which I better keep away.

"I am a 65 yo male who exercises nearly everyday for over 7 years.  The last year I noticed a lack of stamina during my routine daily exercising.  I mentioned to my MD that I thought this was do to me getting old.  He didn't think so.

Went back to my long term MD with the same problem and he did check my Vit D level.  It was 17 (low) so my MD put me on 50,000 IU of Vit D once a week for 6 weeks.  I noticed an improvement in my stamina / endurance withing a couple of weeks and it is continuing. I have had no other side effects as others on this blog have noted.  I take my Vit D in the morning with food.  It is now 8 weeks from diagnosis of low Vit D. I am on 6000 IU a day now.  If  you can believe it, I read all 95 comments.

"I live in sunny SoCal so the sun or my body's processing of vit D wasn't doing such a good job. For approximately 2 years I had been experiencing general body aches and pains.  It got to the point where I could barely walk at night due to excrutiating pain in both feet upon getting out of bed to use the bathroom. My doctor took blood tests (but not for vit D), sent me to a rheumatologist.  Nothing.  Finally, I did my own internet research and requested a vit D blood test.  Well what do you...I was very deficient in vit D.  Also, around the time of this discovery, I started having unusual pains (very painful) in my shoulder area.  X-rays showed calcium deposits in the tissues.  Without the vit D to help absorb the calcium, my body didn't know what to do with the calcium.  Needless to say I suffered unnecessarily for approx 2 years. I don't understand why neither my doctor nor the rheumatologist didn't suspect that I may have been deficient in vit. D.  I started taking 2000-4000 units of vit D3 daily, and within one week, the pain in my feet all but disappeared.  I am a skeptic so I know that it was not any kind of placebo effect but that the vit D was doing its job.","

"I had felt terrible for months... deep fatigue, sleeplessness, aches and pains, foggy brain and every day was a struggle to keep moving.  After I insisted on a diagnosis my doc did a Vit D test and found I was very low.  I had been taking 1000 mg OTC but she raised it to 50000 a week for 12 weeks.  It was amazing.  After a week I woke up, I began sleeping well, eating better, my digestive system was working better and the muscle and joint pain vanished.  The brain fog is gone and I'm functioning well.  I'm 8 weeks into the prescription and feeling fine.  I still have a few weeks to go but I have always known I am sensitive to lack of sunlight and I have a special light to use during the winters.  I take the D with a piece of cheese because I understand it needs some fat to work with. I haven't had any gastric upset or any other negative side effect up to this point.  So far I'm very satisfied. (Sorry, can't find my exact prescription in your list.)    ","

"I had been taking calcium citrate +D-3 and exercising for several years and could not get out of the osteopenia diagnosis when I had a bone scan.  But when I  added vitamin D (2,000 iu) the bone scan  showed that I was no longer in danger of osteoporosis.  My back, between my shoulders, hurt a lot when cooking or doing other tasks that required my hands out in front of me.  The extra vitamin D has also reduced that pain significantly.  That back pain seems to be a prime indication of the lack of calcium and vitamin D in my body.  ","

"For years I would suffer from depression on and off, especially in the winter.  I had noticed that tanning beds helped alleviate this, but I have not been to one in years, and rarely go out in the sun. I was also tired all of the time, and quit excercising because I had no energy.  I was diagnosed with a uterine fibrod tumor about 4 years ago, so I did not know if that was causing weight gain. I am lactose intolerant, so I rarely drink milk.  In passing, I had heard about vit D, but one day it just popped out at me in the store, so I picked it up.  It was instant wonderful.  I took 2000 iu the first couple of days, it gave me so much energy I wondered if I could take more.  Started taking 2000 iu twice a day, and had calcium magnesium and zinc supplement at the house and added that.  Read that vitamin K is necessary as well.  Before I took the calcium and magnesium I was having more pain than normal in a hip that gives me problems.  This stopped when I started the calcium and magnesium.  It is unreal, I feel like my old self.  More energy, sleep less, hip actually feels better, have lost 3 pounds in a week, bleeding from fibroid lessened and today I had to look at my face twice, I actually can tell the difference in my skin.  My eyes were giving me trouble with blurring, even that has improved.  I cannot believe that this vitamin could do so much!","

"About five years ago I was racked with body aches, tiredness, and frequent pneumonia. My doctor tried everything and finally sent me to a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist had a blood test done and found that I was vitamin D deficient. He prescribed vitamin D2 at 50,000u once a week which immediately stopped the pain and pneumonia. Two years ago, I switched to vitamin D3 at 2000u daily which is the natural form. the switch was seamless except that taking the pill daily can be a problem for someone who is forgetful like me. If I miss 2 - 3 days in a row, I immediately return to body aches and tiredness. I know my kidneys do not convert the vitamin D well so I need to keep up with my dose. I am thinking about going back to the D2 once a week just to avoid the hassle of the daily dose. another issue with D3 is that taking more  than 4000u daily can cause serious side effects. I misread the label on a new bottle of D3 and took 5000u daily for about a week. I had vertigo from calcium crystals in my inner ear fluid, calcium deposits in my bladder, and a bout with kidney stones. As long as I stay with my suggested dose of D3, it has been a wonder drug.","

MD ran blood tests which confirmed low vitamin D level (22) as well as TSH levels too high. Was placed on prescription D2 at dosage of 50,000 IU  to be taken 2x per week for an eight week time period. I recently completed week #5 and I can report that my chronic fatigue has subsided. I am no longer sleeping over 11 hours a day. My physical energy levels and my ability to concentrate have improved. Only 3 weeks left to go on this prescribed Regimen dosage and then I will go into to have my levels rechecked. The only side effect that I personally have experienced is an increase in urination, which makes me wonder if my Kidneys are working on overtime...As with any prescribed Rx it is important to communicate with your Physician any concerns or side effects you may be experiencing. Vitamin D plays a critical role in our overall wellness and ultimately the best form of Vitamin D is to get at least 15 minutes of direct sunlight exposure daily (weather permitting). I live in the North & we typically experience brutally cold winters which therefore limits our sun exposure and natural D intake.   ","

I am 5'6"" female, 150 lbs; recently read article that stated 5,000 IU would be for someone who is overweight. Am I taking too much, and would this cause my short-term memory loss?

"I had to ask my Dr to check my Vit D level on the advice of a homeopathic chiropractor - which he had several recommendations of various vit/mineral levels to be checked.  It was 19 (deficient).  I typically take 2,000 - 6,000 IU's daily and  I have gradually felt better.  This is not an overnight process.  Often Dr's don't typically look at vit/mineral levels b/c they are taught to diagnose and prescribe prescription medications.  I have had bone pains and fatigue when initially taking vits/minerals but it went away after a month. I look at it like this - after exercising, the typical feeling is soreness.  Upon consumption of anything, our bodies will experience some sort of physical/emotional/biological feeling because the body is trying to ""purify"" itself.  Symptoms and side effects are not the same thing.  Check with your Dr about what you're feeling and determine whether it is due to (in this case) Vitamin D, or if the Vitamin D is rebuilding your body and the pain is just part of the process.  I currently take the following w/my Vit D: Calcium 500mg, Super B Complex w/Vit C, Zinc 50mg (but plan to reduce dose to 30 or below), and Lactobacillus 25 million.  ","

"For the others who have experienced side effects and stopped taking Vitamin D

Muscle and Bone Pain
Are Vitamin D Side Effects


This is a side effect of vitamin d that is not so easy to remedy and is actually a sign that you really NEED TO CONTINUE taking the vitamin d. If you experience Pain from Vitamin D this very likely means that your bones have become somewhat demineralized from having vitamin d deficiency for a very long time. When your bones are demineralized and you begin Vitamin D Therapy, this can cause calcium to begin to go back into the bones. When the calcium goes into the bones it drags fluids with it. This fluid can actually cause a small expansion of the 'collagen matrix' inside the bones and this expansion pushes out against the exterior covering of the bone which is very inflexible and has extensive nerve endings. 

When this occurs, you can experience this as bone pain or even muscular pain. If you experience new or worsening pain from taking vitamin d, it is NOT Vitamin D Contraindication, a reason to be scared or to stop taking the vitamin d. If you continue with the Vitamin D Therapy, the pain should subside in several weeks. While uncomfortable, you will be better off in the long run if you manage the pain for this time and 'get through' to the other side.

Then took 2x day, w food, no problem for 800iu, which was dr recommendation. Crazy thing for Dr to prescribe 50,000 iu. Just buy your own supplements and ramp up. My muscles felt good again in a few weeks. After a year of 2x day, 400iu, I took a cousin's 1000iu pill, while visiting her. Had odd pulsing at back of brain for a few days, but then adjusted and took this larger dose for years. With eating less yogurt fortified w Vit D, I began 1000iu 2x day, but often forgot to take 2nd one. Trying one pill now, 2000 iu. It makes me very sleepy after 2-3 hours, so I will wait to see if this eases up. Will take w evening snack.  A yr ago, I was outside ea day doing yardwk, so thought I didn't need to take the pills. After 3 months, my muscles were aching again. for the person who mentioned Vit D""3"" (not Vit D2) needs to be noted as the correct version...Vit D3 is the only supplement in the stores now, for the past 7+ years. Someone told me that the prescription version of 50,000 iu is Vit D2, plant based. Again, ramp up w smaller amounts. D3 is the one that is preferred after studies.","

"I have multiple systemic, genetic and acquired conditions causing ligament and muscle pain and now also intermittent bone pain. I have not found any pharmaceuticals that help much with the systemic inflammatory pain I experience if
I ingest a food or substance (like maltodextrin)
that triggers an inflammatory response.  Also
none of the prescription or over-the-counter pain
meds I have tried have helped with the bone pain.
I found out that I had become calcium-depleted from heavy-metal poisoning from a medical implant.
The intense bone pain has consistently responded to Calcium Supplementation which I take along with Magnesium and now Vitamin D.  These 3 working together have helped decrease the widespread muscle pain I experience part of every day. After
years of depletion and mineral imbalances because 
to the level levels of metal in my body, it is a
daily process to keep the muscle pain away or at least at much lower levels.  I no longer experience the bone pain at all unless I forget
to take these supplements for a few days. The
muscle pain is much trickier to control but I know
from experience that for me dietary restrictions,
Calcium/Magnesium in equal amounts and Vitamin D
especially when I can't get out in the sunshine are essential in controlling the recurring widespread muscle pain/spasms.
Reading others negative experiences with Vitamin D, I know first hand sensitivity response
reactions to foods, medicines, and additives that
others handle well.  But also I notice and have
experienced myself that doctors often prescribe
very large doses for all their patients without
starting them out at a lower dose (which may even
be equally effective) to try to minimize any sensitivity reactions or adverse side effects.
After 6 months on a certain medicine, I asked my doctor if she would increase my dose a little bit.  She ""tripled"" my dosage abruptly without ""titrating"" it upward slowly as recommended. 50,000 IU sounds like a lot

"Vit. D was prescribed the 50,000 VD3 IU weekly for 4 weeks. After 1st dose, a few days in, felt horrible, almost a viral feeling. After 2nd dose, felt side effects, headache, muscle aches and spasms, jittery,dizzy, weak and tired. I called my Doctor who said, suffer through, then take 1,000 IU/daily. If I still feel the same, call him right away. I did some research as I didn't want to suffer like I had the 1st week. So I have been taking 500 mg/day of Magnesium during the past week. Although I still feel dizzy, weak a bit, Not as bad and is tolerable. I take IB's to help with body aches and headache. So, wait and see.","

"At the beginning of taking Vit D3 for low levels after bloodwork, I felt better. I started on 2,000 iu daily. Went back for more blood work one month later and the level was still low. Doc told me to increase to 5,000 iu daily. The bloodwork and prescribing took place a year ago (3/2016). I have been on it since then. Lately, I feel dreadful. Fatigue, brain fog, general malaise, aching all over, lack of appetite, sleep issues. Lately, I get moderately nauseated once a day. I have researched, and I am concerned I have too much Vit D in my system.  Also, perhaps it has caused other Vit/Mins to decrease. I will not take it tonight and call my Doc tomorrow. Just wondered if anyone has felt these things with too much Vit D. After researching I think 5,000iu a day for a year was way too much. ","

Every time I've tried it, I have great difficulty sleeping and have had the same or more pain.  This time, after the first pill, I felt very shaky and my legs felt weak.  After the second pill, insomnia with anxiety returns.  I can't stand it.  My rheumatologist tells me that he has never heard of these side effects.  This board helped me feel that it's not in my head.  I will not keep taking these high doses and will take over the counter supplements of 5,000 i.u. daily, which has not bothered me in the past, though my level remains low.  But I have to wonder if this supplement is even warranted.  My levels remain low, along with a huge population of low-vitamin-D patients.  I eat plenty of foods that are high in vitamin D and try to get brief sun exposure as much as I can.","

I was bleeding everytime I went to the toilet and my skin was itching.I read an article about d vitamin and castor oil (a natural oil) on castorolie.dk. They also wrote about manuka honey among others for conditions like acne and cold sore. I tried this oil twice a day and vitamin d (3000IU) for 3 weeks and it healed my wound. It really did help.

My energy level goes up every time I take it and I haven't felt joint and lower back pain the whole time. After reading what D deficiency could cause it's definitely worth doing. I didn't have any side effects whatsoever but I did take it with food.  I also took a multivitamin a couple hours later after reading about your calcium and magnesium levels I need to be in range with D. My thyroid is out of whack which after reading they can go hand-in-hand so I'm hoping my blood work will show that's improved as well.

"You do not discuss allergic reactions to topical Vitamin E (tocopheryl acetate) I burned my leg (small) over 25 years ago - people told me to open Vitamin E pills and put it directly on the burn after it healed to lessen the scar. Within 2 weeks, I had a rash head to toe. After that, I couldn't use any lotions with Vitamin E in them. I still can't. My dermatologist who I have been going to for the last 4 years, has never heard of this allergy, but said it is possible. Since I notice I break out from using things with it, and am ok with items when it's not included, she said to continue with what I am doing. I check every soap, lotion, sunscreen etc for Vitamin E (tocopheryl acetate). It's in at least 90% of products.","

 This is a VERY HIGH dosage of ""Natural Vit E"", d-alpha tocopheryl acetate was 400 IU/softgel capsule, which is 1333% of RDA; after taking for 3 days I started experiencing lower gastrointestinal bleeding & abdominal cramping, so I have removed this from my daily supplements. This is WAY TOO HIGH OF DOSE! I will just rely on the avocado I eat several times a week. I've also been told in the past to stop all Vit E for at least 1 month prior to surgery due to the increased clotting time and tendency to make you bleed...so more isn't necessarily better for you...it certainly wasn't better for me.

So I skipped the cream and took 400 IU's of Vitamin E for a week, cleared it all right up.  Amazing.  Now, if rosacea starts to appear, I take 400 IU's each day for 1 or 2 days.  Problem goes away.  Doesn't matter what form or brand of Vitamin E.  Can't take it all the time or it causes other problems, so I only take it if the rosacea starts to act up, which is a couple times a year, maybe.","

"I suffered from IBS for over 30 years! I finally BEAT my IBS quite by accident when I started a weight lifting program and bought some WHEY PROTEIN to help me build bigger muscles. 
 Strangely enough, I suddenly found myself having normal daily bowel movements WITHOUT pain or diarhea for the first time in over 30 years since turning 11 years old.

Even after stopping my daily weight lifting program three months ago I am still having normal, pain free, diarhea free daily bowel movements so it was not the exercise that contributed to my beating IBS.

 I have advised others to try it and they have reported the same results as myself. I have no idea why it works, I just KNOW that it does for me and perhaps it will help you as well.
For more info please watch my video on YOUTUBE titled BEAT IBS with WHEY PROTEIN.

Good Luck and my greatest hope for you is that you too can FINALLY lead a normal life as I do now!

I might have the glutathione problem gene, because it has solved many problems: appetite, strength, mood, muscle tone.  Only problem is with the muscle tone I have gained, but I think that will find a healthy level and I can lose again if I just stay on the regimen.

I use vanilla and add cinnamon or any spice I feel like to change the flavor. I love the Cappuccino flavor too. The fruit flavors are to sweet for me. There is No sugar in this brand.

I have used this on all 4 of my children. Seizures run in my family. So I keep a close on my kids when they run a fever and knowing a cool or even warm soak in the bath could pose a threat. I take a damp room temp. wash cloth with witch hazel(not enough that causes strong fumes) place on the crown of their head(works perfect while they sleep) or I place it on their back. Always works. ,"

"I am 53 year old male 5'10"" 220 LB.   Just in the last 5 weeks I have had regular hemmorroid flareup.

Tried 2 different creams, including Prep H., with only temporary relief.

Then my father, a retired doctor, suggested with hazel.  Daily treatment with with hazel had immediate results:  no more itching or discomfort.  Single treatment per day seems to work.

"I had surgery in the anal area (not hemorrhoids), and the doctor suggested sitz baths to soothe the pain and help with the bleeding. They worked, but were too time consuming, and sometimes messy (spilled water). Then I heard that witch hazel worked just as well, if not better, so I tried it. What a difference! Within 2 days the pain and bleeding had lessened! It is also helping with the healing wound itching. Just soak a wad of toilet tissue with the witch hazel, and blot on the affected area.","

I reccomend Spry cinnamon and fruit flavored gums, which are comparable to Wrigley's Big Red and Juicy Fruit.","

"I use Xlear Nasal Spray when I travel and it has greatly increased my comfort and decreased my incidence of sinus trouble during and after a hotel stay. I find that when I start to use Xlear a few days before a trip and while on the trip I do not get a sore throat or increased mucous production. I recently to a vacation and was on a plane for 18 hours. The air was very dry and most of my seat mates felt like they were getting a sore throat and that their noses were dry. I had none of these symptoms as I was using Xlear while on the plane. I carry it will me at all times even when home. I've tried other nasal sprays to relieve dryness but none work as well as Xlear does for all of my travel related symtoms.

He used the Nasal spray only after the Oral surgeon said it was ok to use and he was amazed at the quick healing process that occured. His implants will be placed at a record pace because of the healing properties of xylitol. He also chews orbit gum with xylitol and he has not had a cavity for many years.

Last night I chewed 22 pieces close together, probably chewing 48 pieces in the day.  I estimate that the 22 pieces contained 16 grams of Xylitol.  After that I developed a horrible burning in my chest and back running down my digestive tract into my stomach.  Perhaps this is what is called cramping. The pain was bad enough to seek medical attention but since I thought it was due to Xylitol I tried self treatment.  I ate two apples (a fibre source) and drank two cups of soy milk (for dilution and soothing).  The pain diminished and subsided.

Tastes just like sugar, so it's a great substitute when baking(No-one will know the difference!).
I have been using it for about 2 1/2 - 3 years now, and I've been overall very satisfied.
It's great for those who don't want sugar in their diet, but love the sweetness of it.
The texture in the granulated form is different from caster sugar, but not much.
I've been meaning to experiment with it more, like making Jam, and icing sugar.

A bit of warning, do not intake more than 40-50 grams a day. In fact I'd drop that amount still. It can indeed cause diarrhea, bloating, and gassiness as I've experienced first hand :/
It may help those who have constipation. I don't recommend it as a proper treatment though. I'd stick to high fiber foods.","

Since I was unfamiliar with this product I proceeded with caution using only less than half a teaspoon of Xylitol to a cup of coffee/tea. After reading some of the other reports here about it I realize that it does cause loose bowels. I haven't suffered with diarrhea but noticed stools are looser than usual.

On my last dental checkup my hygienist asked me what I had been doing to my teeth.  I asked her why she asked that question and she replied ""because you have very little plaque on your teeth and you will only require half the time of your appointment"".  I then told her that I had been chewing Xylitol chewing gum after eating and she was very impressed.  That says a lot, considering that it is cutting down on their billing time. I highly recommend it and I have given it to my family.  It will be interesting to see the results of their next dental checkups. Try it, what have you got to lose, except maybe some plaque!

Well Splenda (Sucralose), another artificial sweetener did the same thing. At that time when I had the Splenda reaction, I went to the Doctor and he said that some artificial sweeteners can throw off the electrical rhythm of your heart. Plus the mouthwash was the only new thing I introduced to my diet. I am sure this is a rare symptom - I have seen only a few reports of people associating it with this, but it really sucks when it happens to you. ","

"I wake up by coughing badly, never happened to me before I starting using this product. I think that before it melts completely it turns smaller and smaller until the little chunks are barley attached to your gums. Those chunks can't hold to the gums anymore and break off, when they do, they go to your airways (not stomach). Probably more so, if you are snoring. That would explain the severity of the cough and the timing (5:30, 6:00 AM). I use disks before I go to bed. I love these tables otherwise, my mouth is not dry when I wake up, it feels moist and sweet. Yet, the cough is bothering me. A feeling of slightly heavy chest too. It goes away quickly, and they say on the box that is is OK to breath it in accidentally as it will melt away inside your lungs. Still, they don't say if it is harmless over a long period of time. Let's say you'd rather cough a bit than have a dry mouth, but what if it damages your lungs over 1-3 year of usage. That concerns me. What are your thoughts? ","

They did the nerve sparing surgery but I still lost a nerve down one side because of the location of the cancer. My PSA was coming back up after the surgery and I had pin point radiation treatment on my prostate bed which didn't work. I was given Lupron to lower my testorone because prostate cancer thrives on testosterone. I have had all kinds of scans done on my body and they can't find the cancer. I told my doctor that I was unable to have an orgasm and he said this was because my testosterone levels were low. He said that Yohimbine would help and it has on several occasions.

Was relieved to see other reviews indicating nausea (thought it was because of my poor diet prior to taking the pills), but was nauseous for hours, dizzy upon standing, and saw little light tracers everywhere! and I stand by the notion that they were NOT a result of cataract surgery in my right eye 5 days prior.  Other information that may be useful is that I am 5'9"", 130lbs, age 36, and only ingested a single pill.  Max Stamina does what it says and only that...nothing more.  After climax the Yohimbe goes up in the tree house and continues to make you feel terrible for several subsequent hours.  Here's to a 2nd night without sleep...ugh!!","

"I read that it helps with energy (often Yohimbe is used in some energy shots). I purchased the pill form of Yohimbe without any other added ingredients and within half an hour I could feel an adrenaline rush. Within 1 hour I was shaking, nervous, feeling jittery, and very unfocused. As far as any sexual increase I did feel a slight sexual increase but nothing to rave about. As far as using it to create energy to work, exercise, or do other activity it was horrible. My hands were shaking too much to do anything. I think Yohimbe is no better than drinking 10 cups of coffee all at once which is unhealthy to do. I think a lot of over the counter products are over rated and most the actual scientific evidence is all too often inconclusive. I would not recommend taking Yohimbe nor any product containing Yohimbe unless you like feeling strung out.","

"I am a very healthy 32 yo male in the medical profession.  Gave Y a try as part of my regimen for weight training for the appetite suppression.  

It WORKED, but the side effects for me were horrific.  I took 5mg of yohimbine HCl around 2pm.  No hunger AT ALL for the rest of the day, but I experienced the heart palpitations, some dizziness and the worst diarrhea of my life.  After about 6 hours, it subsided, however I woke up every 1 hour that night with a RELENTLESS erection.  Never having had any ED issues, this was NOT an added benefit to me.  To hopefully get rid of the erection, I ""took care of myself.""  It went away, but kept coming back all night.

SUMMARY:  For me personally, it worked for appetite suppression with a SIGNIFICANT unwanted boost in the ability to get a maintain an erection.  However, the side effects of nausea, diarrhea and insomnia were no where NEAR the benefit.  Too dangerous, and will not try again.","

"I have had low sex drive and mild ED for about 15 years (I'm 35). I sought treatment in every form possible without any significant improvement. I stumbled across Yohimbe in a work out supplement. While using it my ED is all but gone and I have greatly increased sex drive...that being said the side-effects are harsh. I have noticed mildly increased blood-pressure (not enough to be dangerous), insomnia (in high doses this can last up to 24 hours and is the worst side effect), occasional headaches, nervousness and frequent urination. Through trial and error I have found that even a low dosage (approximate 30 mg) of Yohimbe can be effective and the smaller the dose the more manageable the side effects. I see that lots of people complain about nausea. They need to do more research. A side effect of Yohimbe is difficulty processing tyramine. If you eat anything containing tyramine (red wine, cheese, red meat) you are going to have a bad time. Avoid those foods and you will be OK as far as nausea is concerned. Final Summary: It works just avoid the foods above and keep the dose small. In a small dose the effects last about 8 hours. ","

"What a devisive issue here! I've noticed that the old 'steel libido' supplements list far too high of a dose for someone ~170lb mid twenties. It says take 4, thats about 10mg of yohimbine. If you evenly spaced these throughout the day you would probably never sleep. I can take 1 [2.5 mg!!!] and sleep after 5-6 hours have passed. Sensitization comes with use, but there is also something called adrenal fatigue. I don'tt associate any lingeriing toxicity with this, nor would I ever be tempted to take a high dose.

Once I had a bag of 5 grams of yohimbine hcl. I was at a music festival in south america.. havin a good time. I showed some friends I'd met there my bag of yohimbine hoping to trade it for goods or goodwill. I was trying very hard to communicte the dose in spanish to them. They really didn't get the miligrams part of it. The guy dipped his finger in the powder, and I cautioned him profusely en espanol. he licked a dusting of powder off his finger. I saw him later and asked if he was ok. He admitted that it was very strong, as I had initially cautioned him that it was.

I would recommend, personally, the freebase form of yohimbine as it has favorable vaporization characteristics, and I personally would not heat an HCL in hopes it would do anything but decompose. Yohimbine has favorable vasodialation properties, the problem is getting it to the brain around the digestive system, where it tends to just do all sorts of stuff nobody likes.

also I think topical yohimbine has been done or suggested. Get the form right, do your research if you want to go that route. Yohimbine lube anyone? Achieve what none have thought possible... a 6 hour erection. The question is, how long does consent really take? Or, in relative terms, how many thrusts?","

"I never ever had ANY of the sid effects mentioned by pretty much everyone else. I took 300mg only once a day in the morning and it suppressed appetite beyond expectation! MORE than just suppression, I was also just NOT INTERESTED in food at all! BIG distinction since I can eat while not hungry very easily. I slept fine. No palpitations, no stomach upset, no headache, NADA! I was feeling pretty good so after about 4-5 days I took a 2nd dose mid morning, sometimes early afternoon(the bottle recommends two of the 300mg 2-3 times a day so I played it safe). Slept fine at night and still no side effects until maybe the 2nd or 3rd day with the 2nd dose and I began 'breaking out' on my forehead down my nose. THEN it became a 'rash' hives-like situation and I was at first puzzled and upset. I stopped taking 3 other supplements thinking it may be them but realized Yohimbe is known for hives. Sure enough...when I stopped..the horrible face rash began to subside..but slowly. I was bummed. I thought maybe I would only have positive results. I even thought about continuing but with the original one pill (300mg) a day but from what I read, the rash will come back or remain. NO THANK YOU! It was pretty disturbing. Such a shame. But clearly a low dose is KEY. ","

I took it because I heard it gets you wired. BOY OH BOY does it . It also gives you a body high similar to that of mescaline. Though it did upset my stomach it didn't make me sick. It is a very intense high and I would not recomend it to be used by anyone with heart problems.As for a sexual stimulent it works but not until several hours after I took it . Because I was so wired I couldn't even think straight .Possibly because I took 4000 mg on an empty stomach. It is alot more comfortable in a dose half that size taken with food. I think it would be or is a good replacement for meth.It could quite possibley be used to help meth addicts get off meth. But this is only my opinion and I am not an authority on yohimbe I have ben on meth for more than twenty years and it has worked for me . you do the math I think it is a good product it has helped me maybe it can do the same for other people too,"

"Viagra is essentially synthetic yohimbe. Since the drug companies are now price gouging for $40/pill when they use to sell it for $2/pill, you can still get the natural Viagra for $0.20/pill, I'd stockpile it because I am sure big pharma wants to ban it. Since the side effects are almost as bad as Viagra, I'd recommend taking just one pill before bed and use it like Cialis dialy. This is just a short-term solution because the side effects are bad. Seek long-time solutions like L-Dopa, HGW, Panax Gingseng, Tribilous, Maca, and L-Arginine. Other supplements, a good multi-vitamin, iodine, and your super foods (including especially beets, pomegranate, and leafy greens, garlic, grapes, berries, nuts, and chocolate), will also help. L-Dopa should be your primary daily supplement to reverse the effects of taking anti-depressants. The rest just help in multiple ways, including giving you a slight boost like taking a quarter dose of Viagra. Big pharma is as evil as big banks. Avoid them if you can.","

The herbal version of yohimbine is not without problems and most of the side effects are related to the compounds found in the bark. You can get sweats, severe stimulation and chills so I don’t really recommend you the herbal version of Yohimbine.

Yohimbine HCL is a cleaner compound and has all the benefits while retaining none of just a few of the side effects of the herbal version.","

It is also NOT stimulating in any way other than causing horrible uncontrollable shaking in my hands and elevating my heart rate in a way that feels dangerous. This stuff is absolute freakin' garbage poison. As for ""male performance"" it makes sex totally impossible because how can you have sex when you're nauseous as hell and having a several hour long panic attack? There is literally no antidote except maybe clonidine which is an Rx med. Nothing over the counter will help, and believe me don't combine this crap with ephedrine or gingko biloba. You will end up in the hospital. This is such a toxic and horrible herb. I can't believe it replaced ephedrine. Ephedrine is actually very safe compared to yohimbine. I don't recommend ephedrine either, because it can cause bad mood swings but it's a lot safer than yohimbe. ","

"I am 54.  I first started taking Yohimbe back when I was 36, and have been taking  it on and off for the past 18 yrs. It worked GREAT for being able to have a long sustaining erection, and being able to ""recovery"" from lovemaking/sex pretty fast, 10 to 15 mins. I used to purchase Yohimbe pills at the local Walgreens in the SunBright or Cobra brands. Only once did it have a jittery effect, and that was the very first time I used it.  Since then, I have taken it as many as 4pills a day, or at least 1 pill a day.  
  Truly, My health is good for my age. I have no liver damage nor jitteryness, no depression, nokidney failure, no negative side affects at all.
   So when I read these postings desribing bad side affects,...I wondered,..is this for real OR is it being given a bad rap because it works and any guy can buy it online or at a gealthfood store and is not a prescription,  which translated means tgat Drug companies cannot make money off it, other than to negativley brand it as bad/dangerous, while pushing Viagra, or Extenze or any other lab made $$$$ drug?
   Like I said,..I've been using tjis stiff for Decades and,...I'm still here, and no problems as the Pharma paid doctors have written.
  Yohimbe has been used for thousands of years in other countries where amwrican drug corporations are not able to negatively brand it.
  I for one can say it works, it is natural, it is cheap,...and that's why drug pa

I have a herniated disk L5/6, Knees that are bone to bone, carpel/cubital tunnel in both wrist and elbows, headaches,high cholesterol, chronic insomnia, obese and CHF complicated by cardiomegally. I got Moringa via Zija International which uses the entire tree, certified organic, bio-available and enzymatically alive state. In 1 day I was sleeping at will, in 2 days I started losing weight without exercise, in 3 days I was out of pain and in 6 months I no longer had a Heart diagnosis and now I am off all my medications, I feel and look 30 years younger. SInce then I got proactive and decided to learn about Nutrition and Health and have found that 89% of all diseases are nutrition related, and If you give the body what it need, the body will self correct. Moringa has everything the body needs to restore it back to health, restore the immune system, and keep it that way. I have no drugs in my house, I rely on Moringa via Zija International for my nutritional needs, detox, weight, and beauty/skin care needs. I thank God for giving us back the Tree of Life, the Miracle Tree as it is called by many , the only Botanical that can purify water and feed the body everything it needs.

"It’s claimed that choline or lecithin supplements help prevent memory loss and Alzheimer’s disease. Unfortunately, studies in which older people or older lab animals were given extra choline have not found provable cognitive benefits. So why have I taken lecithin since 2001? (1) My mother died of Alzheimer's disease, which means I may have genetic risk. (2) It's definitely safe. The choline nutrient is well recognized as essential for proper cellular function in the brain, so well that some want to classify it as another vitamin. Lecithin is a good source and so safe that it is used in chocolate bars. (3) I can feel it! I have made many on/off experiments over the years, and I'm slightly sharper if I take it. Who knows, maybe I could have had the same positive effect by eating more chocolate, but the positive effect is there. (4) I hate the do-nothing approach when worried by Alzheimer's. You can do a lot. Lecithin is a logical part of a health program of good diet, exercise, and keeping weight under control. I also take a statin to keep cholesterol down, and fish oil for triglycerides. Fish oil is another brain booster too. 

What should you do? First, take enough lecithin to make a difference. I like two 1,200 capsules daily. Second, add fish oil to the regimen. Get a capsule with enough to say one daily dose is enough. Most are too weak to say that. Third, pick a good brand. Sundown is a great brand; the capsules are in good shape and won't stick together like many. Fourth, watch that diet and exercise. If you don't, you cannot save yourself with a pill.   ","

"When I heard about this supplement I started to research it. On January 2nd of 1990 at 2:03 a.m. I died from the Flu that went into pneumonia. Kidney and prostate failure and an enlarged liver. I take 3 GNC 1200 mg in the morning and 2 before or after dinner. Have been on 2 prostate pills for 6 years, no help. Can urinate again without pushing. I can even feel my liver shrinking and the overall pain is less. Go to the VA hospital every month for pain management. This helps my back spasms and migraines also. Was concerned about the dark urine. My Primary Dr. Said that it's the result of cleaning my internal organs. Lecithin is in everything we eat. Just not enough to get the benefits. Taking 5 per day is working for me. Bathroom visits may be a little more frequent, but after surviving pneumonia, and decades of Tylenol without Pain Management. I finally feel that I can lose those extra pounds, once this ""Fatty liver"" is cleaned up.","

"Heard about this on Dr Oz and found 100% PURE lemon balm oil in trial size for $16 on-line. Been using it for nasal herpes and vaginal/anal outbreak prevention for about 6mos. Have had no nasal outbreaks in a year and preventative, bi-weekly or on demand use of oil on my nose, has reduced area itching completely there. I also take valtrex suppressively but only when i feel a tingle or burn somewhere. The only vaginal outbreak occurred recently after taking Vitamin D 3000mgs daily for a couple weeks. The outbreak was healed within 4 days without 'flowering'.  After reviewing comments about Vit D, will discontinue it in high doses going forward for use in minimizing my cramps and be more aware. Oil can be strong on sensitive skin so be careful when applying to private areas as even small amounts can burn. Try cocoa butter or coconut oil as a base to prevent this. Smell is strong but tolerable. Extremely happy with this treatment and recommend its use in your campaign to manage this condition. Said to be effective on preventing mouth cold sores as well. A dab really does do you and the small trial size i bought is still not empty. ","

"This is an update, I couldn't append original review. I've been taking lemon balm for almost three months. The change in how I react and deal with every day issues is amazing. Recently I took time off from work and I realized this is the first time in so many years I didn't sit and fester over issues, worry that I would lose control over my job or don't have an immediate reaction that I'm being conspired against in my absence. Not to say this doesn't happen especially in my company, but with the calmness comes the ability to sift through it all and deal with it confidently so that I don't come off as paranoid or that I'm just out to attack others. And other every day things such as going out into public into places I'd felt uncomfortable in/at has changed. It has also affected how I deal with customers. I'm much easier to interact with and don't get all sound up over service issues. I use lemon balm as well as suntheanine and its a win. I started using theanine first then added the lemon balm, and I'd say the lemon balm is the ringer.","

Lemon Balm calms my anxiety but takes away the benefit of drugs that were stopping my chronic diarrhea because it causes diarrhea.  It also stopped the benefits of drugs that were helping my chronic Fatigue.  I found myself exhausted still the next morning.  The only dose I could tolerate was 1/4 capsule and still be able to function.  It has a sedative effect that made me unable to care properly for my visiting grandchildren.  Caution - DO NOT plan on using power tools while on this supplement.  I had started to feel better on a Chinese herb but once I started Lemon Balm all those benefits disappeared.  It's not worth the effort and cost.  Keep track of your symptoms and open the pill and pour out what you do not need.  I also poured some of the powder into water and it tasted fine - like a lightly flavored tea.  The problem was that every time I used it I had to counteract the bad side effects with the Chinese herb. This capsule was Melissa(Lemon Balm) Extract (Melissa officinalis by Time Laboratories.200 mg.  ,"

Taking Omeprazole for years and it has become toxic to me with psoriasis type rash over my body.  My doctor took me of it and suggested Pepcid and Antacid tablets.  To no avail the Pepcid or tablets had no effect on my GERDS. So I came accross info on Licorice Root and GERDS.  I am taking 2 450mg tablets on a full stomach 2 times daily and my GERDS is great.  No more acid reflux for me.,"

"I was taking a lutein supplement until my doctor set me straight.  He told me that lutein is one of three macular pigments, the other two being zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin.  He told me that people get AMD by sunlight entering the eye and causing free radicals that over time lead to the disease.  The macula pigments are in the surface tissue, and protect the underlying tissue from damage from light, like a shield.  People with low macular pigment are more likely to get AMD.  He told me the pigments are arranged in a bullseye, with meso-zeaxanthin being at the center, zeaxanthin being in the next ring and lutein being in the outer ring.  We get lutein and zeaxanthin in our diet, but not meso.  our bodies convert lutein to mesozeaxanthin.  however, he told me that some people can not convert lutein to meso so they have a hole in their shield and it is right in the center where our best vision is!  so, you need all three pigments to have a healthy functioning shield.  he also told me that the macular pigments are antioxidants, with Mesozeaxanthin being the strongest, followed by zeaxanthin then lutein.  so the macular pigment serves two purposes, it blocks sunlight and for the light that does get through and forms free radicals, it neutralizes them by being antioxidants.  I think I have this straight, but my point is that if you only take lutein as I was, you are not protecting the most important part of the eye.

"well, i am 45 now. i have been living with, i think, presbyopia. i have always been nearsighted, but since i turned 40, i noticed a sharp deterioration in focusing from seeing things up close to far away. for instance, my eyes cannot focus as they used to from looking at my smart phone to looking around the room. and doing so gives me a head ache. so i think this condition is presbyopia.
so i go to a vitamin store, the lady says to me, try this, a bottle of 40 mg lucien. i was skeptical, but i thought, what the heck, why not!?
so i took 1 tablet a day, i did notice a slight difference even after 1 week, but too slight to tell if the vitamin really worked or not. after week 3, yes, it really works! after looking at things near, such as my cell phone , and then looking up and around, my eyes focus, and i don't get a headache.
well so far so good. it is week 3. 40 mg might be a lot though, and i am not sure of the side effects. but that is what lucien has done for me.
by the way, this is an honest an honest review. i am a consumer, i am not being paid by anyone to write this.
i also take a tablet of vitamin a , but i don't think the vitamin a is what has improved my vision because i have taken vitamin a before with no showable effects.","

"well, i am 45 now. i have been living with, i think, presbyopia. i have always been nearsighted, but since i turned 40, i noticed a sharp deterioration in focusing from seeing things up close to far away. for instance, my eyes cannot focus as they used to from looking at my smart phone to looking around the room. and doing so gives me a head ache. so i think this condition is presbyopia.
so i go to a vitamin store, the lady says to me, try this, a bottle of 40 mg lucien. i was skeptical, but i thought, what the heck, why not!?
so i took 1 tablet a day, i did notice a slight difference even after 1 week, but too slight to tell if the vitamin really worked or not. after week 3, yes, it really works! after looking at things near, such as my cell phone , and then looking up and around, my eyes focus, and i don't get a headache.
well so far so good. it is week 3. 40 mg might be a lot though, and i am not sure of the side effects. but that is what lucien has done for me.
by the way, this is an honest an honest review. i am a consumer, i am not being paid by anyone to write this.
i also take a tablet of vitamin a , but i don't think the vitamin a is what has improved my vision because i have taken vitamin a before with no showable effects.","

"I've been taking Bausch + Lomb'S ARED 2 formula regularly for several years.  First year or so I used it intermittently and there was slight progression (slowly getting worse) noticed at the following exam.  That scared me so I stepped up to the daily use 2x/day recommended.  
Subsequent check ups had me happy to hear it wasn't getting worse; I maintained the 2x/daily regiment for at least 2-3 yrs without being told there was progression.
Unfortunately the last checkup (this week) had the doctor concerned, he determined something a little too complicated to explain here, this was discouraging after it had been slowed for those years with regular use. He stepped up the supplement to ICAPS MV, (2) 2x/day. 

As far as side effects, I don''t believe I've experienced any over the years I've used it although I started in my 50's and as a very healthy person.  

The recent progression may be attributed to a couple of life style changes that  I'M trying to curb.  I've been missing lunch and there's one other change and the general recommendation along with these nutrients is to maximize protein consumption.

I seen such a quick improvement eye vision that on days that 20mg seems not enough I take 20mg with breakfast then again with evening meal. I daily also take adrenaline response, q10 200, Adult B Complex, Adult multi vitamin, b-12 STANDARD mg 2 times,  eat raw avocado small size 4-5 times weekly, in summer drink I 64oz JUG vegetable juice w/water A week more is better takes away thirst removes feelings of not enough water during day in the heat works better than gatorade or similar.
Sum this up as over all adding lutein 20-40mg daily to my diet is smart for diabetics type2. I also see improvement in skin on body an lower legs less vein apperance because of adding advacadoes an lutein to diet. This is only change in diet except for smaller portion meals more child like not adult size. You want to see a change of you an your body, do The above vitamins and adrenaline response 2, with veg juice an advacadoes an lutein 20, is smart for type2 diabetes.  My blood test shows consistent mid level range of vitamins an required nutients, bladder,kidneys more in likeness of 38yr old man in my 60s. Been on most vitamins above an q10 for over 10yrs an longer. Added adrenaline response an lutein 20 only past 6 months... Adrenaline response  twice daily helps me .
Get on a regimen and stay with it.

"I sufferered severe reactions to MACA,so I wanted to leave a review. I began taking Maca in my daily smoothies along with Hemp protein. At first, I don't recall any severe reactions, but I was a little more energetic/awake. After a few weeks of taking it 2-3 times/week I began noticing a racing heart a few hours after taking it. Once this began, I removed all other suppliments from my diet, then I took Maca two months later to see how I reacted, and that's when I realized that it was the Maca giving me the anxiety all along. I couldn't drink coffee for months during and after using it or my heart would race and i'd feel extremely anxious which is unusual for me.

If your thyroid is already healthy, I wouldn't recommend taking MACA. It can over stimulate your thyroid and nervous system to an unhealthy level.

"I was recommended the Maca herb by someone else who was using it for the same condition I have, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. It really worked best for me because I was taking a drug called Metforim for my condition and I hated it! Metforim would make me feel sick from lack of food and no desire for food either, I had no sexual desire what so ever, and it physically made me sick as well because I was vomitting, getting headaches, and weak all the time. The Maca fixed all that. I don't feel sick what so ever, I have my desire for sexual contact back and I've been good on my blood testing and I feel great. I would recommend this to anyone who has this problem or problems with sexual desire or with pregnancy. I would warn however that the Maca herb does increase your chances of getting pregnant for both male and female. ","

I did experience more natural energy and major libido increase on first day of use. I looked it up and was not surprised to see it was an aphrodisiac... But the article only mentioned men! I'm here to say its a fantastic aphrodisiac for women as well. I see so many company's claiming to sell real maca powder but it looks like its a little maca with other supplements.

"I began taking Maca just 2 months ago, but my journey has been a long one. My husband & I have been trying to get pregnant since February 2013 (when I stopped taking birth control) with no success. I've had a child & he has one, both from previous relationships, so I assumed fertility shouldn't have been a problem. As I turned 30 & being diabetic, time was of the essence, so I recently tried narrowing it down. 

I had a few cycle apps & started using at home ovulation tests. After closer monitoring I realized my cycles lasted anywhere from 32 days to 40 days, plus I had taken about 40 ovulation tests, all of which were negative. I had horrible side effects from the birth control I had taken in 2013 and I was also running so much I barely had a period for about 6 months. This is where I believe my cycles went haywire.  

I began Maca the day after my period & by the next cycle I had a positive ovulation test! I can't say that my situation is resolved, but it's certainly better than it was. On top of ovulating I've had some other side effects. I've gained 2-3lbs & a cup size, and my mood swings have vanished. Before I was all over the place throughout my cycle & I never had a reason to be upset, sad, or angry. Now maybe a day or 2 before my period I'll be in a bad mood for about half a day, but I wouldn't even call it a mood swing. My energy is about the same but emotionally I feel great, in turn making me more productive.  ","

"Have had postmenoposal issues, at age 61, with painful sex and exteam vaginal dryness.  We have had to almost give up sex with anything more than minimal penetration with it  just too dry and painful for me.  My husband asked me to try a teaspoon of maca powder with my morning protein powder.  After about three weeks we had sex for the first time in months and there was virtually no pain at all and only needed a tiny bit of lubricant.  It was almost a miracle.  My libedo or desire for sex has returned to when I was much younger.  Have been taking maca now for 3 months and feel more upbeat and have a more positive outlook.  Our sex life is now like we were young again with the dryness and vaginal pain completely gone, our intercourse is no longer limited and ginger, and I have more intense organisms. I canâ??t believe what a difference it has made in our relationship, my general positive feelings, and our sex life.  I recommend the organic maca powder that is gelatinized.  The gelatinized is easier on the stomach, start with a 1/2 teaspoonful in a protein powder or breakfast drink, or smoothie, and work your way up to a larger dose.  It is available on Amazon.com.  It really works for me and my husband also takes it too.  I hope it works for you!","

I got irritable, exhausted, the shape of my face changed, for more chubby chicks and an overall more squared face. My appetite got absolutely out of control, I was eating absurd amounts of food, at least 3000kCal/day (I tracked some of these in Chronometer app). My hair and eyebrows started getting scarcer bit by bit. 
In general, I am a pretty healthy person. I eat whole plant based foods, supplement B12 (and D3 in winter and fall), I go to the gym at least 5 times a week, alternating HIIT and weight lifting workouts. I never get sick, I sleep well and have good levels of energy.
Maca powder was really full of unexpected and unwanted side effects.

"I have fibromyalgia, depression and sleep apena with difficulty falling and staying asleep.  I have found a and was told by a specialitst that you need to start with a small dose of magnesium once a day (ie: 250 mg) for a few days and then increase it to twice a day.  Gradually increase the doses until you reach the peak of diarrhea; then back the dosing down until it subsides. Stay on that does awhile and if needed, try taking the dose up gradually again.  I take a 1,000 mg twice a day and it helps with feeling less stressed as well.  Also, for you chocolate cravers...magnesium is in chocolate and magnesium does help reduce and even eliminate cravings, which is different than having a urge to have some chocolate and being satisified.  My friend teases me and says why takes magnesium when you can eat chocolate????  My blood work has been perfectly fine and, as always, discuss this with your MD first.  Not all MD's will support this idea or even understand it (I am a Registered Nurse).  I don't mess with other products as I am on Paxil, which reduces the amount of Aleve I need for the fibromyalgia and, it helps the depression.  I've been living with fibromyalgia and depression since 1979 and am a functional, working woman.  Good luck!","

I have battled Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) for 37 yrs and have been on a Parkinson's Disease medicine for the RLS for 14 years.  I recently started taking magnesium about the same time my doctor took me off the RLS medicine because it began to give me side effects.  I began to realize something was causing my legs to be calm - it is obviously the magnesium - so sorry it was never suggested to me in all these year. I feel so much better and sleep much better as well.  One possible deficiency cause listed on one site was having gluten sensitivity.  I have celiac disease so that fits. I take 1-2 magnesium supplements daily (250 mg each) with calcium.  I just hope it does no harm - how much is too much?,"

"A wise elderly aunt told me years ago that she took magnesium for her restless legs and that I should try it too. I have taken magnesium off and on through the years since then and it has certainly worked for me. Early on, I would let myself run out of it and invariably my restless legs came back within a few days. Restless legs are so uncomfortable that now I never let myself run out of magnesium and if I should let that happen, I am in for a very bad night! More than once, I have made an emergency trip to our 24 hour drug store for my magnesium ""fix"". I take 250 mg in the morning and again, 250 mg before bed, sometimes 500mg if I feel the need.","

In the last 6-8 month muscle cramps all over my body some so severe I felt like i had been hit by a bus for days afterward. Especially bad in my chest and rib cage and neck. A friend of mine suggested magnesium and I can't believe the difference. Before I had pain or cramps 70-80 of the time and I couldn't get to sleep or stay asleep now I feel free. I started with 250mg a day for the first week and then went to 500mg a day after that. I can't tell you how good I feel now. Still have some pain and cramps but now its manageable and I sleep all night! What aggravates me is why none of the doctors in the last 8 years have ever checked my magnesium levels. I guess they were too busy prescribing drugs for me. I personally would rather fix the problem instead of band-aiding it. Hope someone finds this helpful and finds the same relief I did.","

"Read about using supplemental Magnesium in a magazine. Because I am post-menopausal and have osteopenia,along with the other fun symptoms of menopause (not sleeping, profusely sweating with hot flashes and so on), I thought the magnesium good advice. Just a word of caution...do NOT, as I did, double the dosage. I purchased 500 mg capsules, already eat a great diet with plenty of natural magnesium intake, and thought more would be better. One per day as recommended is better. At two, you will spend part of your night in the bathroom. If you are constipated, I'd say magnesium is a great solution to that problem! :-) Good luck!","

"I have been taking ""Natural Calm"" which is a powdered form of Magnesium (ionic magnesium citrate, created from a highly absorbable proprietary blend of citric acid and magnesium carbonate).  It comes in a few different flavors (all natural), and it can be found at Whole Foods stores.  I mix a heaping tablespoon with a glass of water.  It is a relaxing, anti-stress drink, which I take at night (about 30-60 min. before bedtime),and it has helped me greatly in a number of ways:  Helps me to RELAX and SLEEP (I had been plagued with insomnia for years!), AND helps with REGULARITY (bowel movements, as I had also suffered with constipation my whole life).  I was diagnosed w/Fibromyalgia back in the early 1980's, and have tried so many different Rx's over the years, but would end up with unwanted side-effects from each med.  Now, I don't take any Rx meds, just the Natural Calm, plus have changed my diet, which has made a HUGE improvement!  If you're not familiar w/the Paleo diet, you would do yourself an unbelievable favor by checking into it.  It's basically eating REAL food, and eliminating all grains, sugars, and processed ""foods"".  Not only did it help with weight loss, but I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER in so many ways!  Less fatigue, more mental clarity, less fibro-pain, etc.  God bless each of you, in your quest to feel better and become a healthier individual!  :) ","

"250 mg seemed to work somewhat as I have suffered with constipation all of my life. However, when I increased the dose to 500 mg per day, my blood pressure dropped to 90/60. Even splitting the dose 250 a.m. and 250 p.m. It didn't help my migraines at all, but it definitely stopped restless leg syndrome from the crestor and zetia I take for cholesterol. So, be awar of your blood pressure if taking magnesium oxide. If fatigued, sleepy, or dizzy, check your BLOOD PRESSURE! ","

"After suffering from 2-4 migraines for the last 24 years (I am 35 yrs old) I have been migraine free for 3 months. There are some days that I take up to 1,600 mgs of magnesium over the course of a day. It has been amazing to live migraine free when before, I was guaranteed maybe 15 migraine free days a month. I have been prescribed Rx migraine medications that have never given me any relief. I am so grateful to have had 3 people suggest magnesium as a migraine preventative within the span of a week otherwise I might not have tried it. If only one person had suggested it, I might have written it off. ""Ya right, a double helping of magnesium will fix what Dr.s haven't been able to for 24 years!"" We'll, guess what? It works! So this is how non-migraine sufferers live! I could get used to it :)","

"Recently, I was diagnosed with what my PCP calls ""pharmaceutically-induced mood disorder."" 2 years ago, I was on Abilify for a few months for trichotillomania (hair-pulling). I didn't have depression, anxiety, or any mood disorder; apart from the hair-pulling, I was completely healthy. After stopping Abilify cold-turkey (my doctor at the time told me this would be okay; she was WAY wrong), I experienced an intense 5-day-long anxiety attack.  Just constant panic, depression, crying, and depersonalization. On day 5, the ""episode"" ended just as suddenly as it began.

Ever since then, I'd have weeks of normalcy--even a slight euphoria--and then about 3 days of anxiety and depression that would, again, start without warning, and end just as suddenly.  Sometimes it was 3 days, sometimes more; sometimes it was so bad I couldn't function. Some episodes were more mild, but still very disrupting my life. I also began to pull more hair than ever.

I saw many doctors and was diagnosed with everything from General Anxiety, to Postpartum Depression (I gave birth a year ago), to Bipolar disorder. I knew in my heart the Abilify had caused this, somehow.

I read in a few forums about people having great success with TwinLab Amino Fuel, L-glutamine powder, and magnesium (all three taken together in the mornings on an empty stomach--I take 40 mL, 1 teaspoon, and 250 mg, respectively). I decided to give it a try, since I was desperate, and Abilify had scared me off psychiatric drugs permanently.

Within a week, I felt a LOT better. I started taking another 250 mg magnesium before bed, and now (2 months later) I feel even better, almost 100%. I do get ""twinges"" of anxiety now and then, but they are so mild and fleeting, I barely notice them; on these days I take an extra magnesium midday. I know the other supplements are helping a lot too, but the magnesium is great just by itself. It feels like I have my life back!! Highly recommend no matter what kind of anxiety you have.","

"Age 52, female menopausal: I take 160 mg (40% daily value) magnesium citrate (1 capsule) every evening with food, 1 - 2 hours before bedtime.  I also take a vitamin energy drink daily that has 200 mg of magnesium glycinate (50% daily value) each morning with food.  FYI: I also take an ace inhibitor in the evenings for blood pressure.  Warnings say that if you take a potassium blocker for blood pressure you may have an interaction, so be very careful!  I have consistently much lower blood pressure now than ever before.  On average: 90's/60s with a pulse rate in the low 70's. I have considerably less fibro pain, my heart palpitations are rare now and very mild (thyroid disease).  I have greatly reduced hot flashes and night sweats, greatly reduced irritability and anxiety, greatly reduced headaches and more energy throughout the day and better focus and concentration.  I am taking the magnesium side by side with 26 billion active bacteria (probiotics) each day.  I take these right before bed when I take my magnesium (because both give me putrid gas for several hours).  This is a side effect not mentioned on the labels of either product.  FYI.  But this it is the only adverse side effect I’ve noticed that I have!  The combination of these two supplements has really improved my mood and overall sense of well being.  Anxiety and negative thinking is now rare and very short lived.  I no longer feel bloated because the digestive tract and bowels are moving, and I have more energy and a positive outlook.  I am amazed that probiotics can actually improve your mental acuity, focus and sense of well being!  Everybody should take these! Read about the immune system and how it effects EVERYTHING in the human body, especially the digestive system, heart and brain!  When I started using magnesium WITH high quality probiotics (I also am very self aware of my stress levels) my old self came back, but a better version.  A healthy diet with exercise make this work even better!","

"I will start by saying I am medically a bit weird. That being said, I take magnesium as needed for difficulty with concentration, anxiety, fatigue, and muscle weakness. I am diagnosed with polyendocrine issues related to autoimmune dysfunction, am in remission for myasthenia after a thymectomy, have PCOS, mild diabetes, and am subclinical but being monitored for Hashimoto's and Cushings. I have mild to moderate incontinence, and was told the magnesium might help with that as well...

That being said, I ONLY take my magnesium supplement when the symptoms I noted above (except the incontinence) become almost disabling, because of a horrible side effect - I feel such strong urinary urges that I feel like I have a UTI, my kidneys ache, and my bladder cramps, all on the day after I take a magnesium tablet. I drink extra water to try to alleviate some of it, with minimal results.

My supplement isn't in the list below - Nature's Bounty 500 mg high potency Magnesium.

I do not know if this is related to my genetics, the autoimmune situation specifically, or of it is something else. I wanted to bring it up here because I'm baffled by its usage as a urinary tract relaxant. That is not my experience.","

"I've been using this product for well over a year for various reasons (slightly high blood pressure, slightly elevated cholesterol, fibromyalgia, and just for its general antioxidant properties). I should note that I also began taking several other supplements at that time as well after researching how I might naturally improve the aforementioned issues.  In the past year or so my blood pressure and my cholesterol improved and were within normal ranges. My fibrymyalgia also seemed to calm down some. In the past couple of weeks my blood pressure is elevated again and my fibromyalgia pain levels have increased. I have been baffled and concerned as to why all of a sudden this happened. It took me a few days to get it, but I realized that I ran out of my pycnogenol supplements and did not reorder because of all the holiday activities.  I just figured I'd order it after the holidays.  But once it dawned on me that the reason for the flair up of my issues may well be the lack of taking pycnogenol, I ordered it ASAP.  I am looking forward to seeing if everything goes back to normal ranges once I begin taking it again. I believe it will. ","

"Immediate noticable improvement in severe pitted edema that had been unresponsive to all pharmaceutical solutions for 18 months after anaphlaxis.  After 24 hours my socks no longer left indents and after one week no more pitting on shins, fingers or cheek bones. Unexpected benefit of reducing my need for 400 mg of Ultram per day to 150 mg of Ultram per day. Had extremely foul and cloudy urine for first 48 hours on pycnogenol and then no more kidney pain, no more pain near splean and currently feel more alive than I have in years. It also seemed to immediately eliminate my cravings for carbs. I had been sleep eating for years and noticed it stopped after 48 hours on pycnogenol. Amazing little pill that I tried because my local health store told me another customer with a medical education had healed thier cancer partly due to pycnogenol and I was so desperate to have any quality of life at all after 8 years with an EBV triggered Rheumatoid arthritis with co-existing fibromyalgia and worst of all almost daily bouts with Trigeminal Neuralgia because the arthritis had attacked my jaw joints, that I bought it and tried it and was so grateful for taking the chance.","

"I've never posted a review on this web-site, but I feel it's important to post this one for other people who may have pine allergies.
I purchased a skin serum with Pycnogenol as the primary ingredient. The intended use of the serum was to calm and soothe the easily irritated skin on my face. Certain foods & environmental factors make my skin very red and inflamed, and this product claimed to help with my symptoms. Unfortunately (and shame on me) I didn't realize that Pycnogenol is derived from Pine trees. I tested positive for ""Pine Mix"" during my allergy screening but never ""put two and two together"" when using this face serum. It took me about a month of being miserable, a trip to my allergy doctor, and tons of blood work to realize that the serum was making my allergies WAY worse. The primary adverse reaction that I had was dry mouth and subtle swelling of my tongue, which was very scary. It also seemed that while using this serum (twice/ day,) I was more sensitive to other foods/ environmental factors that set off my allergies.
In my opinion, if you have any kind of sensitivity to Pine, you should stay away from this ingredient.","

This is literally just a placebo pill. There is nothing in this capsule that actually helps with anything. It's pine dust. I've never had any benefit from taking these. I suffer from endometriosis and my mother recommended this as a way to treat it. I took it for a couple years and it has done absolutely nothing for me. It changed nothing at all. I honestly believe this is just a homeopathic scam 'drug'. Don't waste your money on it. Go get a real medicine from a doctor that will actually help your conditions.,"

"I have CMT (Charcot Marie Tooth). I take 100mg daily. Been taking it about 20 years. Before taking it I wrote down every little thing that seemed to bother me and after about 2 mo. I had several improvements. Don't remember what they were (lost the paper).The important one was my CMT. When my legs got cold I could hardly move my feet and it was hard to walk, and I would fall because my feet would not pick up in order to take a step. It also effected my hands. With Pycnogenol, my hands and feet work ok when cold. My 54 yr old son has been off his Pycnogenol for about 2 months (doctor wanted him off all supplements) and yesterday he got cold and could hardly walk. He has been on it for a long time and had not had this problem till now. He also has CMT. I take Swanson Pycnogenol (French maritime pine bark extract) ","

"Years ago  we heard about it from a chiropractor who was taking it for its high antiocidant features and his shoulder pain went away.  So since my husband had shoulder pain too and was going to have to quit work, and  I had bad bruising, wWe took Pycnogenol.  The pain went away, the bruises went away.  We ran out of Pycnogenol and the pain came back and the bruises. Back to the Pycnogenol and they were gone.  After taking it for a while both problem were gone.  My son told four friends with carpel tunnel.  Four cures.  After two months of P.T. for a pinched nerve in my neck with no help, I remembered Pycnogenol and within a week I was back to normal!  They say you need ! mg per pound of body weight.  We've been taking it for years.  Now I am 80 and people keep commenting how young I look.  Maybe it is because of the Pycnogenol?  I didn't know it was good for that.  Now I am using  2 100 mg. Pine Bark as it is much cheaper but supposed to have the same effect.  I think people that don't get good results aren't taking enough.","

"First off? 

IT WORKS.

But Big Pharma cannot control it, so therefore it is ""POSSIBLY SAFE"".

What a crock.

Indians have used it FOR CENTURIES.

'Big Pharma' RUINED my heart. 2 med' were mixed by a doctor who SHOULD NOT BE PRACTICING - 20+ Malpractice suits pending - but he goes on and on.

I got  antibiotic colitis, was told ""it was all my head"", and ended up with persistent atrial fibrillation. I pro-tennis athlete with ZERO heart history.

Long story short, segue 6 years LATER when I was FINALLY ably to receive treatment. My Ejection Fraction was down to 27/28%!!!

They asked if I could GET OUT OF A CHAIR, UNAIDED! I still had to work, teach, and play tennis LIKE THIS!

The cutoff for an Ablation (I wanted to start simple - not MAZE, Pacemaker, etc) was an E/F of 35%.

The surgeon told me there was ""no way"" to raise my E/F.

Started researching, and discovered a heart study with Pycnogenol.

45 days later, final Echo.

36%.

A 30% INCREASE.

Numbness? Tingling? At night, laying down?

Mine was increasing DESPITE a very successful Ablation.

Restarted Pyc', 3 x 360mg, spread out through the day.

Numbness and tingling (and right foot being colder) have dissipated to almost nothing.

My doctors are like 'ho hum', or ""hmmmmm"", but since THERE IS NO KICKBACK AS THERE IS IN ALL THE HIGH-END PHARMACEUTICALS?

You won't EVER hear about it.

Which is also why Big Pharma wants to make most 'alternative' (read: NATURAL) medicine ILLEGAL.

Trust me; If they can ban this stuff? It will come back, on TV, with a catchy little tune...PYTESTOLLLLLLL....la la la....

At $500+ a month.

Pricks.

WEB MD?

I attribute this to [occasionally] taking 25mg of metformin when I feel I might consume too many carbs. I rarely take metformin because of my semi-vegan diet & workouts. Since 08 my highest A1c was 6.2 & lowest was 5.7. Doc sez I actually only have to do the A1c once a year. I'm super skeptical when it comes to supplements, but this pycnogenol & L-arginine/citrulline for hypertension has my bio markers exactly where I want them.

Cons: Dry mouth and skin on hands feels really leathery when in water for more than a minute. Skin returns to normal and dry mouth is reduced after about a week or not using it. The lower blood sugar can also catch you off guard. Others have reported this supplement will cause an allergic reaction if you're allergic to pine. It's also expensive, particularly if labeled ""Pycnogenol"". Other cheaper supplements advertise similar benefits and you may want to consider those if you experience issues taking this or want to save money. ","

"My six year old has behavioral issues and would not sleep. Her psyciatrist recommended 3mg melatonin a 1/2 hour before bedtime. He recommended the NOW brand which is sold at our local whole foods co0op. It's under $4 for 60. I buy the powdered capsuls and slip it into her food. Any hot food, soup, or on cinnamon sugar toast. I don't do drinks because she can taste it. 
Anyways it has been a God send. I finally know what quiet adult time is at night. I read to her a bit and soon she is asleep. 
Melatonin as mentioned does not keep her asleep all night (which isn't a problem for us). There is no drowsiness in the morning, in fact she is much less cranky and refreshed. I can't say how thankful for this product I am!
By the way the NOW brand does not have the additives others do, which is why Dr recommended. Hope this help someone else!","

"I have had problems falling to sleep for years. I have taken RX - Ambien and Lunesta off and on for 3-4 years. While these brands work great for falling asleep, they are habit forming. In between prescription meds, I started taking Melatonin. It's not Ambien (Knocks me out in 10 min) but it does put me in a relaxing state and helps me fall asleep. I have absolutely no side effects in the morning. Due to its mild and subtle nature, I have decided to use it full time instead of just in between RX.    ","

I started with 1 3mg pill, but now I take 2 because it works faster.

"Had non 24-hour sleep-wake disorder for twenty years.  I take 3mg of melatonin approximately mid-day to advance my sleep phase.  The timing needs to be precise in relationship to my internal body clock, which is not always easy to know.  If I wake after an hour of heavy dream sleep, my waking time is a reliable marker and I will take melatonin eight hours later.  If I hit the right timing window, I'll have fairly strong fatigue within an hour.  This lasts for a couple of hours.  I can't do certain kinds of work in this state, but I can do housework and listen to lectures.  I call it my stupid pill, but it doesn't actually make me stupid, but impairs my ability to generate outward focus.  Missing my window even once can make it hard to recover the required timing accuracy.  The difference is profound.  I can tell I miss the window because I have far less fatigue.  Taking coffee at the same time as the melatonin significantly reduces fatigue, but it also made the treatment less reliable.  Used to have an ""all nighter"" without fail at least once every three weeks for twenty years.  In my first year on melatonin, I lost control only three times and had to flip over.  Variability in the potency messed me up on one of those.  One vendor didn't work at all.  Another vendor works well most of the time, but some bottles aren't all there.  Think I get mild stomach irritation at night, nothing really to complain about, and it could be other things in the pill.  My life is spectacularly better since I discover this, having found the research myself.  Would love to find a 100% consistent formulation.

I have to order it via the internet as it is still not available in UK.

He slows down, sits for a bit to have a small healthy snack then he's ready for bed. It has created a GREAT bedtime routine for him and definitely helps him slow down his hyperness. He actually forms an attention span during his slow down time that he has a chance to relax.  We have not noticed any side affects at this time with him and he takes it voluntarily by mouth.

I am an elderly female with recent life changes (widowhood and loss of a precious daughter) resulting in my being unable to get to sleep at night even tho I kept busy during the day.  I started taking 3mg oral melatonin with 25mg Theanine about an hour before lying down to sleep.  I am asleep within 30 min.  Taking this melatonin has been a lifesaver for me.,"

"I have only been taking Melatonin for three days but I have already noticed side-effects. I do go to sleep and stay asleep, I even wake up feeling refreshed. I have been getting vivid, strange dreams but then again that isn't uncommon for me. My main side-effect, and the reason why I will probably no longer use Melatonin, is on the second day I began experiencing depression. My mother and grandmother also use it and have never complained about side-effects so I suppose it works differently for everyone.","

"I have been using Melatonin for a few months now. The past month or so, I have been having very intense, strange & vivid dreams. Also, I can remember them. Before I began taking it I very rarely had dreams or nightmares. I have been doing a little research online and have found that when your quality of sleep gets better, number of dreams (as well as recalling them) increases. I have also learned that taking 6mg per night (my dosage) has no known ill effects and is very safe. Some studies even show health benefits, although I'm not sure how many are verified. While it does help me get to sleep at night, and usually doesn't cause much more than normal morning drowsiness, the content of my dreams are VERY strange, and very vivid. I would recommend this product, as it is a chemical that your brain naturally releases & has not been known to cause dependancy like other OTC sleep aids. While it works great, I would tell anyone thinking about taking it to expect to have strange dreams. Anyone else having strange dreams caused by melatonin?","

"I have an extremely wide wake/sleep cycle and tried melatonin to help get on a regular cycle. Taking 5mg didn't kick in until an hour had passed, but I would wake up almost every hour afterwards. Those moments of being awake were met with distorted vision/mild hallucinations. Every wake felt like a power nap, and I'd force myself to sleep again. 

The hallucinations involved watery vision, where everything resembled liquid waves, and complete distortion of light. I've only experienced something similar in my childhood during a shroom trip. As far as I know I'm the only person in my circle to ever experience this melatonin trip effect, and unlike the shrooms it was nonstimulant and basically I thought I was going crazy. 

Upped the dose to 10mg the next night just to test, and it was identical, no more or less crazy.

I suppose this works for some people, but I really can't handle whatever it is doing to my mind or body. Like I said before tho, I must be a super rare case.","

"I took this at night time, because my mother made me. She did not review any of the side effects and I doubt that she even thought that it could have a bad reaction with my ADD medication, 40mg Vyvanse in pill form. The Melatonin caused me to stay awake all night, oddly, which is the opposite of what it is supposed to do. Usually, I get around a few hours of sleep, early in the morning, because of a combination of Vyvanse and my mother keeping the television on all night. In the morning, when my mother tried to 'wake me up,' which was annoying because she yelled a lot. Today, all day, I felt like I was going to vomit. I have had a lot of head rushes in the past few weeks, which could be because of high blood pressure caused by the Vyvanse, and the head rushes are really bad, from able to be ignored to extreme amounts of pain and almost fainting, but I can live with the head rushes. I feel almost addicted to school, the homework and projects keep me from sitting there and not doing anything, which has gotten me scared about summer. I am intimidated and almost scared about what I will do when I am alone, and not taking drivers ed or going to summer school to learn about high school schedules, because I cannot sleep most nights, I wake up early but am not a morning person, and I feel sick most days when I am not working. Does anyone have any tips about getting to sleep? I have zero sense of time, the only way I know it is morning is because of the extremely loud and stupid birds.

Unfortunately, I did not stay asleep. I would have terrible, disturbing nightmares that woke me up regularly. I also experienced neck pain and extreme grogginess upon waking the next day (which was likely due to tossing and turning all night).

After taking the pills for a few weeks, I decided to stop. I have high anxiety, and the dreams I experienced were worse than the insomnia I was previously battling.","

Ive read that its best for people to take .03 mg, because higher dosages cancels out the effectiveness of this drug. So, its best to start out with the lower dosages and then go up as needed.

"I use melatonin a few nights a week when I sense I will have trouble sleeping. I can tell usually about an hour or so before I normally go to sleep. If I'm not getting sleepy then I'll take some. I've researched it pretty heavily and believe it is a good supplement. My overall advice is to only use as needed to give your body a chance to produce it on it's own. My personal recommendation is to take 3 to 5 and no more than 6 mgs. about 30 to 60 minutes before you want to fall asleep. More than that is not recommended by any source. I've experienced weird vivid dreams but never nightmares. My dreams are more bizarre than anything and seem to be in high definition!

"I am a 32 year old male, 6'5"" and roughly 170 lbs (at my heaviest), diagnosed with fibro 2.5 years ago, infrequent (0-5 cigarettes/day) smoker, very little (1-2 drinks/week) alchohol use, 1-2 cups of coffee per day (never past 5pm); exercises (yoga + strenuous stretching) 6 days/week. Trouble falling and staying asleep. Erratic work schedule. I use melatonin infrequently but with extremely high doses (ie used 20mg last night). Result: vivid dreams, but it helps to keep me asleep. Normally I'll sleep for 4 hours, then wake, sometimes can't fall asleep again. Chronic fatigue. I'm reviewing just to let people know that this dosage is safe for me (I feel well rested, still tired but not wired, not irritable). The dreams are to be looked out for, like I said extremely vivid especially the first couple times using melatonin.
The diagnose of fibro should convey to readers that I have experienced chronic physiological (specifically muscular and nervous system) arousal for prolonged periods of time (10-15 years) due to environmental and emotional stress & poor cultural/familial support for stress resolution. Worst instance of emotional stress from 9-22 years old. It has not been fun. If you are in a similar circumstance, good luck to you, I know you know how difficult reversing/counteracting this situation can be.","

I have not slept well in over 10 years. The first night I took the melatonin dual release I was up 3 times but quickly fell back asleep. That has been the pattern over the past week. I have had no issues getting up in the morning anymore. I have not been exhausted and I am back in the gym. It has been a lifesaver for me.,"

Initially melatonin worked brilliantly in the fact that an hour after taking it I slept like a baby till the morning.  Unfortunately as the week wore on I felt exhausted during the day and on one occasion slept the whole day.  I then began to get the shakes quite badly in my hands and legs.  On top of this I began to get very teary...I am on Lithium for Bi Polar 2 which was giving me the insomnia.  Today I decided to go off the Melatonin and I am feeling brighter and did not feel the need to go to bed this afternoon as I did before.  I will probably get the insomnia back but the side effects are too much for me.,"

"Benzodiazepines cause tolerance and physical dependence within two to four weeks, and, upon cessation acute withdrawal traditionally requires tapered management. Additionally in some long term users experience withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal syndrome can last many months and is typified by a major depressive episode, agitation, and lack of ability to get to sleep. This is a serious side effect which needs careful monitoring.
ol
For this reason Benzodiazepines need to be used with extreme caution and for very short periods.

Melatonin is effective for sleep disturbances that are not caused by an over active nervous system, such is in the case of Benzodiazepine withdrawal. It appears virtually ineffective during acute (tapered) withdrawal, although somewhat helpful during withdrawal syndrome. For this reason it's main purpose during withdrawal is an adjunct with other therapies.

To my knowledge Melatonin does not effect the calcium channels that have been disturbed by benzodiazepine usage and this is why, in my view, Melatonin is not very effective on it's own as an Anxiolytic (antianxiety agent.)

My experience is that SSRI's are not very effective for use for withdrawal, however responses to SSRI's are individual dependant.

It is essential to manage benzodiazepine withdrawal and protracted withdrawal syndrome using a variety of methods including CBT, but most effectively, using an alternative Anxiolytic, the most effective of which is Phenibut (CALMEXA).

Phenibut Calmexa is GABA with a phenyl ring that allows it to pass the blood brain barrier, therefore replacing the GABA depleted by benzodiazepine dependence. With medical management it can safely and entirely replace the use of Benzodiazepines, causing an alternative dependence both easier to taper with less risk of protracted withdrawal syndrome. 

Melatonin used together with Phenibut is very effective for inducing sleep, establishing and maintaining a sleeping pattern.

"I have a chronic back pain condition with degenerative disc disease, herniated discs, stenosis, and a host of other things including high blood pressure and sleep apnea.  My pain tolerance is so high that even the class 2 meds i take give short term relief. One doc in the er came back after giving pain shot and was shocked I was still awake saying I gave you enough to knock out a horse. He had not seen that high tolerance before.
I was unable to use my cpap correctly because I was tossing and turning in pain or discomfort in finding a comfortable sleep position and waking up because of the apnea.   I have had  chronic insomnia for over 20 years tried everything including prescription meds. Tried melatonin appropriate 2 months ago. Been able to get at least 4 to 5 straight hours of sleep. Wake up not drowsy and feeling more rested than I have in years. From a chronic pain and insomnia suffered this gives me hope. I use to be so tired during the day from restless night. I know there was strain on my heart and body due to constant lack of sleep. Now I can use the cpap with the goal of reaching 6 to 8 hours. I started with 3 pills down to 2 looking toward being able to just take one.
Different people have different response I am just thankful for sleep. You don't miss something till you don't have it.

"I have been taking melatonin for about 12 years for sleep problems - started at about 300 mcg ~1/2 hour before bedtime, increasing, when effectiveness lagged, gradually to 3 mg (i use the Natrol 3 mg tablet, which was not listed, so I used the Natrol 5 mg for this comment). Added 50 mg Bendryl (diphenhydramine)per night a few years ago and have not needed to change either dose since. I sleep through the night and wake up refreshed but sometimes a bit groggy. A good cardio workout takes care of that. Very important - try cutting down, or better, eliminating caffeine. 
I've tried a number of brands of melatonin, but many don't work. I've settled on Natrol, because it works. There are probably others that work also, but I haven't seen any reason to experiment unless/until the Natrol becomes unavailable or stops working. Remember that these are not manufactured as drugs and there is no required test for what's in the tablet. If the first brand doesn't work for  you, try others until you find one. That doesn't mean you will necessarily succeed - melatonin doesn't work for everybody. Try it, though. Start with low doses and adjust as you see how it affects you. Good luck!","

"For myself, suffering insomnia and PTSD, I had a rather bad experience while taking it for 10 nights as a trial solution. Rather than put me to sleep it woke me up and gave me moe energy in the first few hours after taking it each night my dreams or rather My nightmares were much much more vivid  and memorable, before this i cannot remember having or at least remembering any dreams in the last 6 months. When I did sleep, every third day or so, my sleep was much shorter topping out between 3 and  hours. Then for the 2 days after I stopped taking it I slept about 21 hours a day and was extremely groggy when I was awake (afterwards, that is after the 2 day snooze fest, I returned to my normal insomnia problems.)But the worst side effect, reportedto me by family and coworker, was that while I kept taking the melatonin I was extremely irritable, easily annoyed and angered, not to mention so energized and thinking and talking a mile a minute most of the time when I had to be really alert for work, I guess to compensate my groginess (a sort of adrenaline rush of some kind and I imagine it was like some people feel when on speed or something, or immediately after coming off of it. It got so bad at one point that I was suspended for three days from my management job because I scared an employee and maybe even a few. Which is the exact opposite of what people usually tell me, i.e. I am usually so patient, happy, understanding, forgiving and helpfull.    Anyway, that was my experience of it. As a result I am sure I will never try melatonin supplements ever again for the treatment of my insomnia.","

"I have used melatonin for several years as does my husband. I like that it is not addictive. I particularly like it when my schedule is irregular and I need to get to bed earlier than normal for an early am appointment. It gets you sleepy in about 20 mins. (of course it's best to start settling down for the evening). It is a dream enhancer though, the higher the dose as in 5-10mg the more one will tend to dream. This can make one feel as though they haven't slept. Best to start with a small dose and increase until you find a dosage that makes you sleepy in the 20 min range. Then go to bed. If you don't your body will just work it through and it will do no good. I also like to combine this with Valerian root which produces a sound sleep. Also non addictive. One of each on any given work night is about the right dose for me.  The melatonin dose is 1mg and the valerian is 500 mg.  I have taken up to 10 mg of melatonin with no ill effects, however you will need 8-11 hours of sleep with that dosage and you may still wake up groggy. I have also taken up to 2000 mg of valerian root with no ill effects and no grogginess (in case you have never taken valerian root it smells like dirty socks, really dirty socks lol).  Both products are relatively inexpensive. My size is 5'4"" and I weight around 145-150. Judge your dosage according to your size. I have used nearly all makes and models of both products","

During all this time I had diarrhea which is not normal for me at all. I didn't relate to the melatonin because I never heard of it causing diarrhea. At first the diarrhea was off and on, I guess because I only took the melatonin twice a week. But this past month taking it every night I got diarrhea so extreme after anything I ate.  I'd take Imodium and then I wouldn't go for two days and when I went again, it was diarrhea. So I googled melatonin to see if anyone else was having this same experience and Lo and behold I saw I wasn't alone. So I stopped taking it and no more diarrhea!

"If you find the right one, yes, melatonin can be effective. Possibly even ""addictive"" (or cause a dependence); I'm tempted to take the ""good ones"" for afternoon naps!

But the problem is, each brand and dose of melatonin (and possibly each ""batch"") is SO different. A few brands have worked consistently better than prescription sleep aids for me, but unfortunately MOST brands are either ineffective, or produce the opposite effect desired (eg, I needed a Xanax to counteract the nervous, gittery feelings, then I still couldn't sleep but at least I wasn't jittery.)

One 3mg brand I like is pretty consistent for me (and $3/month! cheap!), but the same brand has a few other doses, plus a ""dissolvable"" 3mg dose with sweetening added, and of course all the bottles look the same, so I've accidentally bought the wrong ones (or if the right ones were sold out, tried another dose): ALL the other doses of the ""good brand"" didn't work. And the sugary one gave me the ""nervousness"" effect.

After a few YEARS of trying melatonin for sleep (on and off), though I have a decent one now, I really think the FDA should be looking at what these vitamin companies put into these pills. At least there should be consistency from ""batch to batch"" (same brand/dose).

So when you hit luck with a good one, it's very effective. But it really feels like a crapshoot when you open the next bottle. I'd love to put my brand/dose as 5-star satisfaction, but since this review is just ""melatonin"", I've got to consider the rest of my experiences with melatonin. Mostly positive, but even the few times I've gotten ""the jitters"" ...why package and sell a sleep aid that makes insomnia a nightmare? It makes it tempting to go back to prescription meds (where the FDA at least has a say).","

"I'd been using melatonin regularly for 4 years with great efficacy for the treatment of insomnia and anxiety. However, a year ago I began experiencing issues with peripheral vascular disease associated with varicose veins (ulcerations and subcutaneous bleeding on my calves, joint pain and stiffness, planar fasciitis and chronic leg cramps). 

Within weeks of treating my varicose veins with compression stockings and elevation, I noted increased postural tachycardia, which became debilitating after 3 months (could no longer work). While waiting to see my PCP, I came off the melatonin and both my tachycardia and varicose veins began improving significantly. Three weeks after discontinuing its use, the tachycardia disappeared and the varicose veins improved enough to allow me to go without compressions stockings for intervals of several hours.

Have found nothing to explain the correlation but for a study in European Journal of Phramocology, vol 345, 1 March 1998 (NIH medical journal database), where the authors discuss the presence of MT1 & MT2 receptors (to which melatonin binds) in smooth muscle of vascular tissue and their role in vasodilation and constriction, respectively, as an explanation for melatonin’s systemic efficacy.

While my overall condition improved when I discontinued use, I did experience a brief period of cognitive impairment and an uptick in mean blood pressure, the latter of which may require me to seek treatment should it persist. Finally have a follow-up with a cardiologist.

Melatonin has the reverse effect on me.  Instead of making me sleep it causes me to be so wired-up I am alert all night. I persisted with the treatment on my doctor's advice despite being desperately tired but even on the best of nights I could only manage about 30 minutes sleep. within a short time of taking the melatonin I had a headache which persisted all night.  With all my heart I wished this treatment to have been successful because I have had insomnia all my life.  A normal night of sleep for me is 3 hours and broken sleep at that.   ,"

"This tree has remarkably changed my life the first thing I would like to mention is there a 58 different varieties of the tree, and it grows in many different places such as India, Africa, the Philippines, Mexico, and Hawaii to name a few. But it grows best in places close to the equator.it's incredibly important to do your due diligence to research what variety you intend to take and its nutritional value.the variety that grows in India is actually the most nutrient dense. And was named plant of the year in 2008 by the National Institute of Health. it has also been quoted by John Hopkins University for saying it will in fact cure, treat, & arrest over 320 different diseases.it's also incredibly important to be seeing if your variety of Moringa is in fact organic, and it has to be fully organic. Which means no pesticides, herbacides or fungicides. it's also extremely important to look at how the tree was grown, and what conditions, and how the tree was harvested, which includes how it was dried. If it was dried in heat, or in the shade. Shade drying is much more expensive and time consuming, however it is critical to keep the bioavailabilityof the plant alive and heat/sun  drying will kill all of the nutrients which will mean you're basically eating grass clippings nutrition wise.my best suggestion to everyone reading this is to do your research, look for Moringa that comes with a guarantee in from a credible organic source.my own personal experience since I started using Moringa has been: I no longer suffer from the back pain the used to experience from being hit by truck 25 years ago, my energy levels are through the roof, my son who suffered from ADD issues have had phenomenal results with his mental clarity and ability to concentrate, my 4 year old daughter won't stop going through growth spurts, and we very rarely have a cold or the flu in our house. My mother has also had phenomenal results with her arthriris.","

I accidentally cured my athletes foot and annihilated 2 huge warts that had been with me for over 5 years.  While in Jamaica I had been given about a dozen moringa seeds and was told it was used for many medical uses.  I ate them throughout a 7 day period.  My athletes foot was a very bad condition and I had been on several prescription topical treatments without a lot of success.  Athelete foot was totally gone on my 3rd day.  Warts gone by the 7th day.  I since getting home have ordered 1000 seeds and eat 3 daily as well as my wife and 13 year old daughter.  My daughter has almost no acne since (was a problem before) and my wife has lost about 15 pounds changing nothing in her eating/activities.  We just got home from Jamaica 2 weeks ago and got our seeds about a week ago.  Waiting to see if maybe a miracle happens with my wife's high blood pressure.  Will update in a month or so about this.,"

This powder has given back needed energy taken from the thyroid problems. I find that mixing it with orange juice and a small amount of honey helps me to ingest it.

"As a child to my adult hood I was diagnosed with diabetes and have been on insulin since I was at the age of four, as an adult it was hard and I grew more into depression each day so one day I started experimenting with different herbs and teas for diabetic and nothing worked. Some herbs actually made my diabetes worse and put me in the hospital. One day I was doing a diabetes glucose training class and a doctor came to me and gave me a small bottle she said it was Nebedaye take it and it will help out with your diabetes. Of course I was hesitant so I left it in my kitchen cabinet when I got home. Three months went bye I was at a book club and a few of my girlfriends were talking about it so I went home and tried it I took it for 6 months did not tell my doctor just to get assurance if it works, my doctor at that time told me during my appointment that my insulin dosage needs to be reduced drastically and I cried. To make a long story short by the blessing of God and Moringa I have been insulin free for the last 4 years. I thank the people from purenebedaye.com because there natural capsules have truly changed my life. I was never into herbs and tea but I am a living proof that purenebedaye.com moringa products work. Everything is not for everybody but purenebedaye.com natural pure nebedaye moringa is right for me. I take these capsules 3 times a day and I have never felt so free and alive. I am for ever greatful for mother nature because for me this is truly a miracle plant for me. Im insulin free baby!","

"I grow my own Moringa trees as well as using commercial supplements when needed.  My overall health was very poor six years ago when I started Moringa usage from my own trees.  I now have blood workups on a quarterly basis which are in the normal to near normal range.  I am no longer prediabetic.  I no longer use a cane.  I no longer have frequent bouts of Chronic Bronchitis.  I cannot say all is due to Moringa but I believe it is involved in the general improvement of my health.

I had many trips to the doctor to find out what was wrong with no answer. I felt like I was slowly dying. A workmate told me about Moringa Leaf Powder Organic. I started out taking half a teaspoon twice a day. From the first day of taking it it settled by stomach. I feel like a new person health wise and I am so thankful. It isn't easy to consume especially with water. The best two ways I have found to take it is mixing it in applesauce and a sup of tea. I am happy with the results of taking this product. So far I have lost 8 pounds. I'm so thankful for the improvements with my stomach issues. My abdominal swelling, extreme belching, abdominal pain, constipation, intestinal pain and heartburn is gone. To me this product has been worth it's weight in gold. I feel so much better since starting this product. And it has curbed my appetite.

"I have been using Organic Moringa Powder for over 3 weeks now. I have noticed a great improvement in my energy level and overall feeling of wellness. The first day I went to the bathroom more but since then, everything has been pretty normal. I have noticed also that my ankles are no longer swelling and my joints haven't been painful as they were prior to taking moringa powder. I mix a half teaspoon with a small amount of water, to make a paste until it dissolves, then I add more water and drink it as a tea. I drink it like this or I might add a teaspoon of honey. So glad I discovered Moringa powder. ","

This is a powerful cleansing food and if you eat the typical American diet, are overweight/underweight, never went on a cleansing diet or just simply want to include this as a dietary supplement---You must use 1/2 teaspoon daily or less, every day or other day if you get a strong reaction the first day-so your body can release the residuals from daily living slowly and easier.

This is the best weight loss I've ever had without having to physically workout. It works as a very easy laxative and appetite suppressant and it gives me energy but it's not harsh on my body at all.

"I had probably been drink'g Bigelow's Chinese Oolong tea sporadically for about a year or more, when I noticed that it seemed to have a beneficial effect on my eyes' ability to focus for a short period of time!!  Not satisfied with a couple of hours at a time, I began drinking 60 to 80 ozs a day.  To my dismay the benefit didn't seem to be cumulative, AND I started to have the side effect of pulled (scalp!) muscles; after about 8 wks, if I'd raise my head off my pillow, I would often get a twinge in a muscle in my scalp.  Backing off to 10 ozs (sometimes 20 'cuz I've come to like the taste) seems to have remedied that issue.  The ""eye benefit"" is only sporadically reliable.       >>>To the person using Oolong for DERMATITIS / ITCHING...Try CINNAMON, either on toast, or as capsules (drug stores, organic food stores, etc.  I have eczema, and rely on this horticultural gem to keep me SANE!!)<<<","

"Oolong tea is a traditional Chinese ceremonial tea. Its medical value is incidental, I believe, to the joy of drinking it. High quality Oolong tea can be re-steeped numerous times, up to five or six. The caffeine in the tea is extracted through the first steeping so you aren't going to be inundating your body with caffeine if you drink it correctly. I would never go with a tea-bag version. Buy loose leaf with a nice sized tea steeper and steep at around 200 degrees Fahrenheit (not boiling though you can see the little bubbles on the sides of the glass.

Some Oolong varietals that I highly recommend (for their taste, mainly)--Dragon Oolong, Milk Oolong, Iron Goddess Ooling and so many more. 

As a note, I have both anxiety and panic disorders and I don't find the amount of caffeine in the tea to aggravate my symptoms, though it does wake me up and improve cognitive function (at least from a subjective viewpoint). Also, it curbs cravings for me. I don't even think about food. I think this is as much about the satisfying mouthfeel as it is about the caffeine. 

Obviously, if you are intolerant to caffeine, you should not drink the first steeping. While I would still talk to my doctor before doing this, I have had customers with caffeine problems steep out the caffeine, pour out the first glass (or better yet share it) and then drink five more steepings. It really is hearty and fantastic.","

While I can't say what will work for others, I can say that these two dietary supplements have been essential to my recovery.

Made me appreciate the status quo but would love to experience a little mood elevation.","

"I ordered this medication for mental alertness, not knowing much about it. So I had few expectations. I took it for about two weeks laxidazlidly. I must tell you, right away, that I suffer from a rare condition caused by an overgrowth of neuroreceptors in my brain for a certain medication I took for three years. It was a potent muscle relaxant used for spasms following a C6-C7 fusion. I became disabled with chronic pain throughout my body from brain damage. I also suffer from major depressive disorder, which worsened since I became disabled. After taking this suppliment for two weeks, I started to work on projects around the house that I put off for years. I didn't think much of it, until I had noticed this intense motivation to get my lengthy list completed. It's been two months into that list and I've almost completed it! My motivation has never been so high since my disability began. As far as my depression goes, I have paradoxical reactions to almost every psychotropic medication, especially SSRIs, SNRIs, and Welbutrin. No anti-depressent has ever worked on me... EVER! After being on DLPH for two and a half months now, here's all I can attest to. This is the only anti-depressent that has ever worked!!!; my motivation is at an all-time high since 2009; my pain is at an all-time low since 2009; and I can work 8 to 10 hours a day instead of 2 to 5. Even my strees is down which is a major set-off for my pain episodes. I'm on a lot of medication and have to normally take it every three hours. Since DLPH started working, I can go at least 5, if not 6 hours between doses. I'm a total skeptic!! And it was extremely unusual for me to even try a supliment like this. But for some reason, I did. So far, it has been life transforming. I am an unusual case with a plethora of problems. This may not be as effective for everyone who tries it. I've learned the hard way that I have very unusual chemistry. Just try it and see what happens. I can't recommend it enough!","

Honestly I really haven't noticed any appreciable benefits or changes. But since I was in a coma almost two years ago and had a lot of chronic anxiety, I've kept taking it for general health, neuroprotective properties, possible (reputed) lessening of cortisol (stress hormone) and to see if it helps in the long run. I take Vitacost which is usually a very good brand making quality supplements. It's not cheap (something like $70 for 300 softgels). I've tried many of the well-publicized nootropics (cognitive enhancers) such as bacopa, ashwaganda, l-theanine, fish oil, calamus, n-acetylcysteine, B-12, methylofolate, ginseng, etc.). I don't have cognitive impairment but, like most everyone, I wouldn't mind being and feeling ""smarter."" (As usual, WebMD failed to list the appropriate ""reason for taking this treatment"" in the dropdown menu, so I had to select ""cognitive impairment"" which was the closest to ""cognitive improvement."" WebMD really needs to improve these dropdown menus for ""reasons for taking."" They often omit some of the most popular reasons people take a given treatment.) Most effective so far, I think, was l-theanine for cognition, inositol for anxiety, damiana for anxiety/depression. I've reviewed some of these other supplements elsewhere on this site. My summation about PS is, go ahead and try it if you want to see if it might help. I haven't had any negative side effects. But it has not seemed to be all that helpful for me.","

I started 4 months ago with 100mg and was somewhat dizzi and confused after first dose. Decided then to take it in the evening and upgraded dose up to 300mg in a few weeks. Sleep has improved massively. Im relaxed and enjoyable in daily life and can work as scientist again. Stopped a few days and yeah I realized the difference. My anxienty and agitation have improved! In combination with high doses of methylcobalamine, very small dose of methylphenidat and duloxetin I feel healthy and can do competitive sports.","

I have always struggled with word retrieval, remembering anything, short attention span, getting stuck on topics, and constantly thinking about things besides what I should be thinking about.

First, I researched the product and it seemed safe so I took a sample. Wow did it help! After about an hour I noticed a lot. I was a lot calmer with less anxiety and I could focus a lot more. I was not thinking about everything anymore and just what I was supposed to be doing. I had less word retrieval problems and I could remember to do things. Everyone could tell something was different about me (I'm a senior in high school). I feel like I'm on ADHD meds without the bad effects basically.

I got three samples and they worked great. Now I am out but I plan to buy some soon. This stuff really works!","

"09-12-15—Please accept this brief-as-I-can-make-it rough-draft for factual info on Memory loss experiences from an 82 year old great-grandma. 
Suffered Equine Encephalitis at age 12 (1945 Unusually high west Texas rain & mosquito infestation affected my birthday present filly. Then my symptoms appeared likely from mosquito bite: Mama couldn't wake me for school. (I loved school!) I could not get enough sleep for six or eight weeks. EE in humans was not recognized by doctors at the time. 
After realizing later I was having short-term memory issues, we ""connected dots"" back to a two-year stress-related amnesia episode at age 20 (death of my infant) followed by short term memory not-recognized until age 62. I was Psych tested--declared not dementia—but …”Short-Term Memory in the basement”. 
Reflecting back, I had become ""Sticky-Note Queen"" as single parent supporting 4 Talented and Gifted children; helping with their homework, etc, during which time I Aced the GED exam at a nearby university.
Later, I discovered documented confirmation that PS and IV Vitamins brought 5 year Alzheimer patients all the way back. Maybe PS would help ST Memory.
PS gave me headaches. Search produced a balanced combination of PS, Phosphatidyl Choline, Ginkgo Biloba and Folic Acid which greatly helps to the extent I can go to town without my list. When I miss for 3 weeks, I'm more forgetful, but helps again after 3 weeks back on it. 
But I’m now back to sticky notes, so I've needed to up intake of this combination. As stress increases in preparing for world eventualities, am suspecting I need more PS.  Will try the Soy based.

BTW-I am an auto-didactic investigative reporter and ""Health Nut""... and have written 500+ pages Holy Spirit-led journal/book on beating arthritis & other ills including memory loss without “conventional” med. 
Forgive the short-hand text! Just want you to have the facts.
Many thanks to Web-Med for help through the years… and for this opportunity to share.

Shalom

"Living with SVD which eventually leads to Dementia, common neurological erratic within my immediate family. Been taking 300mg a day for several years now and the associated anxiety which is the by product of the cognitive impairment or blockages is very subtle to none. I have also found that you must take this supplement for approx one week before any improvements are evident. One draw back is if you do not take the supplement daily and miss several days the Cognitive impairment comes back along with Anxiety associated with headaches. Again, approx a week on 300mg a day almost brings you back to normal.  In the beginning I had started off with 100mg a day which I felt after 2 years was not sufficient and found some Anxiety would begin. Today, 300mg for just over 2 years now is now borderline in providing enough to stabilize. This supplement is a bit pricey in Canada so moving to 500mg, which I feel the right dosage, a day with no subsidies would start to put some strain on the pocket.   ","

I just do not have hot flashes anymore.  I feel more balanced, though I also increased my exercise to five times a week.  I didnt have the energy before to do that before.

"i was on 100m.g. of progesterone,along with estrogen,estradol, and tetosterone;i had next to zero hormones in me before this medicine-i take all of this in the pump,cream form.have been on all of these since july 2013.last month,my dr. upped my dosage of progesterone to 200m.g. due to excessive bleeding 23 out of 30 days. i took this dosage for 2 wks. and the bleeding stopped.when i went to get my refill,the pharmacist was enraged that i had been on such a high amount of progesterone as i was taking all of the meds in a pump,it upped the other meds. as well. now they have me on a pump still,and 150m.g. of progesterone and straightened the others out.i dont feel as good as i did-minus the heavy bleeding the last month.ive gained weight like crazy and this is driving me nuts. i have been eating less,started the plexus slim with accelerater over 2 wks. ago and have gained instead of lost. i have always maintained my weight,very slim and trim. my question- what is causing this and how can i stop it? please help!! amy","

"I take Progesterone orally quarterly during the year (every 3 months) for 14 days to force my body to menstruate, as I'm going through menopause and have been on HRT for 5+ years.  My periods stopped coming on their own 10 months ago.  The medication does cause me to have a period; however, I hate the way it makes me feel.  Breast tenderness, and the worst is extreme bloating and water gain all through my mid-section (abdomen, stomach) to the point it's uncomfortable to sit in any position.  I can't take a deep breath, I hate taking this stuff. The prescription requires taking one capsule before bed, and it's hard to remember taking a pill in the evening, as I typically take all vitamins, etc. in the morning.","

"I've only been taking the capsules for 3 months. Today starts month 4. I'm not sure if they're ""natural"" or not. The bottle says ""Progesterone 250 mg."" The prescription was filled by a ""compounding"" pharmacy. My doctor (CNP) told me that both the cream and capsules were ""natural."" But according to the write-up on this website, natural is a ""misnomer."" Now I'm confused.
Nevertheless, I didn't have any clotting last month and my amount of bleeding was much more manageable. I actually cried one day I was so happy. If you think that that's silly than you don't how heavy bleeding can be. If you ""get it"" than you know what I've been going through.
My cycle is pretty short 21 to 23 days. Ideally, I'm suppose to take the capsules for 12 days starting on day 15, but I've only been getting 6 or 7 days of use before my cycle starts again. So, I was pretty excited when my third cycle was considerably lighter!
The reason I came on this website is to research something to see if it's normal. I started the capsules for the first time this cycle today. I've been an emotional wreck! I'm suppose to take them at night, but forgot last night, so I took one this morning. It seems like that's happened before. I'm going to log it on my calendar and see if I see a pattern. Since I turned 40 (seven years ago,) I've had my emotional day consistently around day 6 or 7. So today (day 16) seems strange. Coincidence???
 Just researching to see if anyone else has issues with emotions and progesterone use.","

"i use progesterone cream , just a dab( dime sized) after my shower, which is right after my 5 mile walk/run. I take it to stabilize my reduced hormone output  due to thyroid problems( hypothyroid) i was given armour 90 mg, i was supposed to get better , but so many told me to use progesterone as well to balance the armour, and i think it is helping a little, i feel better,and think i,m losing some weight, which is also a problem with hypothyroidism. all my efforts ( walking 4/5 miles etc.etc.) are now starting to pay off ( after 5 months of no weight loss).SO, i must say that a little progesterone cream every other day , has helped me . It may not work for you, i had heart flutters before i started the armour or the progesterone, so on that item i can't say it is better or worse. it is the same ,every few weeks or 2 months orso i have an episode where i feel the PCV( premature Ventricular Contraction) go off for a day orso , and not have any for weeks. that may be due to my weight problem before all this started, and I had to take vaccines ( 7 of them) for my hospital job which i think contributed to my heart flutters.

"Well I was really anxious to get the product because I was having hot flashes.  I can say the hot flashes were not as intense, however, I begin to get headaches, tooth aches, and left side of jaw ached with a pounding.  Took me about four days to figure out where it was coming from; I went to the dentist --no cavity. The dentist told me not my department check your sinuses so I did. I took Claritin D, watched Ned on You Tube to clear up sinuses. No real Luck. Then I asked God to show me the problem. It came in a dream step by step when the headaches started. When I started with the progesterone cream my head, teeth, and left side of my jaw went crazy. Also my hair begin to come out do not want to leave that out.

"I am 47 and this is my seventh month taking progesterone orally as a liquid gel capsule.  I started this treatment because I was bleeding heavily for six weeks at a time.  The bleeding was crazy and I could barely leave the house.  Immediately this therapy regulated my periods.  I take the capsule the first twelve days of the month, an hour before bedtime, and it usually makes me so sleepy and dizzy that I almost stumble to bed. I sleep great those twelve nights.  If I have to get up early, sometimes the symptoms of tiredness have not worn off (like when I take nyquil).  I make sure I get at least 8 hours of sleep when I take progesterone, otherwise I feel foggy in the morning.  Getting enough sleep is easy for me because I work second shift and seldom arise before 8 A.M.  I would never recommend taking it in the morning since it makes me tired and dizzy. The pharmacist explained to me that the liquid gel capsule form of progesterone is the form that causes drowsiness because it mimics human progesterone more closely than other forms.  The bottle says, ""may cause drowsiness"".  The previous reviewer mentioned that she missed a dose and therefore took the dose in the morning.  I would not recommend that because of reasons stated previously!  But I am not a doctor nor pharmacist!","

"Estrogen Dominance diagnosis nearly killed me. I almost died with insomnia, arrhythmia, tachycardia and almost had a syncopal episode thanks to the crap bioidentical progesterone cream I was given. Come to find out after being told over and over by worthless Naturopaths that I am estrogen dominant. I took a look at my actual ESTRADIOL blood levels done by a MEDICAL DOCTOR and saw that every time I felt like crap my Estradiol was 6 or 10. Wow, low and behold after starting hormone therapy with estrogen I feel 100% better. I am so pissed at all the money I spent on this and my quality of life suffering for months and years. I started to read articles by Dr. John Studd that talked about women being diagnosed with mental health conditions that COMPLETELY resolved after being given high levels of estrogen not progesterone. I believe my postpartum problems could have been totally solved with estrogen as when my menses stopped, I stopped sleeping. I am glad I refused SSRIs. I am also wondering if I am not only completely intolerant to progesterone from hormone replacing therapies but the kind I naturally produce on my OWN as in my Luteal phase I become a complete MESS!! I think so called “Dr. Lee” and his estrogen dominance theory and the Women’s Health Initiative stopping estrogen therapy for perimenopause and menopause completely has ruined the lives of many women like me. My mom even passed away of cardiomyopathy that I truly believe was due to no estrogen and tachycardia for years. Truly despicable.","

My breasts have grown from 36D to 38DD over the 1 1/2 years of using the product. Now my breasts are very sore and very uncomfortable. I often wear a bra to bed.

I accidently skipped a dose and realized a few days later that day I hadn't been so tired.  I went back on it and the longer I took it the more built in the fatigue was.

What was wrong with me? I HAD a cough with wheezing and excessive thick green-brown mucous *the kind that will choke you if you cough unexpectedly* and a runny nose but not a traditional cold I can only assume some type of lung infection since I recently stopped smoking.
Well before I could finish my coffee cup of the mixture the juicy cough was gone and as I type this review the runny nose is DRY and I am trying to force a cough but my lungs are also DRY!!!! I've been dealing with this for over 3 weeks and someone told me about the Broncolin w/ real lemons today and the problem is GONE!!!!","

"3weeks ago I bit the inside of my cheek at night while I was asleep..Iwoke up with a big swollen lump, no open sore. It would not go away due to be so swollen, getting bit as I talked and at night hitting my teeth. I purchased propolis tincture and applied it with a q-tip. At once the swelling was going away!  I mean NOW. Fast, help to my swollen cheek. What a relief , it felt kind of like a patch or dry, shrinking very fast. Like a thin plaster patch. It worked, the swelling kept going down. Last night I wet a piece of cotton and applied some drops of the tincture. I put it on my sore lump for about 1-2hours. When I removed it , viola,  it was 85-90% gone! No kidding! I wore a mouth guard at night to keep it protected from my teeth. 
This morning, it was even better than last night. I have applied it again on a cotton piece for about 1/2 hour. All the swelling is gone, only a small skin tag remains. At this rate, I expect it will be 100% gone by tomorrow for sure the next day. Thank the Bees ! ","

"Great thread, how fun. 

I have done extensive writing on this and in short raw puer is a weight loss tea as well as a weight gain tea, depending on WHEN it is consumed. If aft er meal, it helps aid digestion and will be a weight loss aid; if consumed before a meal it increases appetite and lowers glucose level, causing us to want to eat. 

A SIMPLE way to overcome this, is to have a piece of fruit or sweet with your tea, it will rid your body of the ""tea high"" and the diziness, ect.

"What makes pu erh the darling of weight loss enthusiasts is the fact that during the aging process of this tea, it develops naturally-occurring lovastatin — a chemical found in prescriptions to lower cholesterol.

Research says pu erh lowers triglycerides and LDL, or low density lipoprotein, also known as ""bad"" cholesterol. It has also shown it may contribute to raise levels of HDL, high density lipoprotein, or ""good"" cholesterol.

Some people say drinking pu erh makes them hungry, so I suggest not drinking it before having a meal. Drink it after a meal instead. Pu erh increases your metabolism, which means hunger pangs would be magnified if you drink it while you’re hungry. Needless to say, never take it on an empty stomach!

I started using Pu'erh Tea after stumbling on this guide and so far I'm happy and excited with the resuls.

"Obviously, the very specific problem you have determines Quercetin's overall effectiveness.  If you need an antihistamine effect, great.  I apparently have too low of DAO production in my intestines to process histamines sufficiently and therefore need to raise my DAO rather than suppress my histamines.  It made me feel worse rather than better, which didn't make sense until I did more research.

Very embarrassing and uncomfortable. often had a severe itch which led to raw, bleeding skin which then would be swollen. Went to several dermatologist through the years with no luck. Just by shear luck and chance I found that I had high histamine brought on by sulphur containing foods and lotions and soaps. I heard Quercetin with Bromalean would help this and it did! 100% recovered if I take both daily...which I am. My roscea on my face is even improved.

"My massage therapist told me about Quercetin when I was complaining about side effects the OTC allergy/sinus medications.  I tried it.  It worked SO MUCH BETTER and has no side effects!  I do have to take it at least twice a day, it seems the effects wear off, but I am not complaining!  I have laryngeal dystonia and has Botox injections in my vocal cords every few months, and, typically, my immune system goes haywire and I have moderate to severe respiratory symptoms ""like the flu.""  With the Quercetin, the symptoms have improved significantly and the side effects of the Botox are not as difficult to live with!  I am also benefiting from the effects on other issues in my life, I am sure (such as the blood pressure, heart and other benefits of Quercetin), but it is the Botox side effects that were my primary focus.  I am very thankful I found Quercetin.  Now I look for Brands that do not include magnesium stearate in the mixture (which dilutes the benefits approximately 5/6 because it creates a chemical reaction that reduces the beneficial component's ability to mix/digest), and I am good to go.","

I stopped taking it now (as it's been two weeks) and I am miserable and haven't had a solid nights sleep in a week and my mood has been awful and the hot flashes soon appeared.  The reason, I had read an article that stated you shouldn't take Quercetin more than 3 months.  However, I have learned that article was not accurate.  Needless to say, as soon as I get my order I will begin taking the product again.  (500 mg 1 - 2 times/day).  I prefer the PURE brand as it's only has the bioflavinoid and no fillers.  ","

(I was working out several days a week and I had cut back on calories but was only loosing a pound a week, which I thought wasn't enough for all the effort I was making.) After rigorous research, I added approximately two (2) teaspoons of VCO (unrefined) to my diet, taking one spoon in the morning and one in evening. I began to lose approximately five (5) pounds a week. Amazing. I also noticed I had more energy (metabolism boost?), my appetite (and craving for sweets) decreased, and I felt healthier in general (combination of the oil, working out, diet change I'm sure). When I fell off the coconut wagon, the difference was very noticeable. My cravings for sugar returned, my weight ballooned upward again, less energy etc. Not good. I'm slowly getting back to the routine, minus the gym work outs. This time I will be walking and adding free weights (at home).

"I have always had problems with underarm odor since I was about 9. I would get teased all the time by family,friends, coworkers, just about anybody I came in contact with. My self-esteem was low. No matter how many times I washed my underarms and put deordarant on my arms would still stink. I felt so defeated and depressed. There would be days I would wash my underarms and put deordarant on about 20x a day and they would still stink. After doing research online about underarm body odor cures I read about chlorophyll pills. I didn't get to excited and was kinda skeptical about it because I have tried other products claiming to help with the odor. I went to a local vitamin store purchased them for about 14$. I took them about 3 pills a day and I didn't see any change until the 3rd week of taking them. Then I realized a huge change in my underarm odor. They didn't stink like they used too! I have reduced my daily pill regimen from 3 pills a day to once a day. My underarms still get a little smelly but nuthing a little soap and deordarant can't do.

"I do apologize in advance.. if some of my descriptions bot so pc. .but I am trying to give a trstimony of my experience. I have been experiencing bad flatulence (gas) for the past year or so and felt hopeless at times.  It's one of those conditions that make even the most social butterfly want to curl back into their original cocoon..felt almost hopeless of being happy because I am so consumed with worrying and anxiety of unexpected gas. My digestive problem is so bad that I noticed especially after I drink any liquid..especially water..I get really gass :( Prior to trying liquid chlorophyll (LC), I tried a lot of other natural remedies and didn't find them very effective with treating the problem. I can't believe this herbal remedy is so powerful.. yet so underrated! 
The most effective way to use LC is to add a tablespoon to a glass of water and drink after a meal. This will really help...even if you have some gas...it is odorless! (Thank god)! Lastly, I want to add I have only been using this one day.  I will post if I have any side effects from this or if the effectiveness changes.  
I believe for any problems, any challenges one faces..there is always a viable solution to find.  Keep trying as it builds character! 
Overcoming a challenge and hardship is what life is about! 

Cheers

"Someone recommended I take chlorophyll for my acne problem.  I drink liquid chlorophyll often and found it does clear up my skin and I also take it for general health and detoxification.  I am a smoker (natural cigs only, but I have no illusions, I need to quit. And I drink wine often.  Other than those which I admit are bad, my diet is mostly raw vegetables and no sugar.)  So I take this to help my skin and to help balance out the effects of smoking and other toxins from living in LA.  Excellent.  I never have bad breath despite smoking.  And I've been told I smell good all the time.  Never body odor. I highly recommend Chlorophyll. I also recommend (to Shay who commented earlier)  Crystal body deodorant.  You can get it at Rite Aid or CVS. It comes in a purple capped bottle.  It's natural salts that kill bacteria under your arms and anywhere you put it.  It is an absolute odor eliminator.  I got my fiance to try it and he was amazed.  It won't stop you from sweating, so nylon clothes can get sweaty and smell as the deodorant is on you, not your clothes, but you can change your shirt and you still don't smell. I even use it when I get a very sore throat.  I put some on a q tip and swab the back of my throat.  Helps almost immediately. Hope this helps someone!","

"first I took it for my liver enzymes being high. ALT was above average chronically. so I took it to protect the good liver cells. it ended up bringing my fatty liver back in the range after years of being high. also, cool stuff was that I was losing weight in the places on my body it would not leave. I did lift daily (less than 10 min) with minimal cardio. I lost 60 lbs, by restricting some calories in morning and trying not to eat as much in dinner unless its veggies or fruits. I do eat sweets at night everyday for a snack and my sugar is also in line. choline is amazing. I take 1g a day, 1 in morning and 1 at night. bitarate form. also, for men, I noticed that it does raise testosterone which might aid in the loss of weight, and increase of energy, and recovery. but, I think its main purpose is liver protection and a fat unjammer. good luck!","

I've noticed that if I run out of chromium, the effect on my blood sugar is the same as if I ran out of a prescription diabetes drug. The increase in my blood sugar is immediate and noticeable.  The lady who said it made her jittery might not have read the part about being careful about drinking too much caffeine with it as it can enhance the effect of the caffeine. It doesn't bother me to have a cup of coffee or tea, but I'm not one of those 2 pots a day coffee drinkers.

"CAUTION! My wife had diabetes and high blood pressure for 20 years. She start taking chromium and other vitamins and herbs ALONG WITH HER INSULIN to try to improve her blood sugar, and perhaps improve her pancreas function. We started with low doses. After a month, she decided to stop taking her insulin and BP meds. She gradually increased the chromium (100 to 400 twice a day) and other vitamins and herbs until her blood sugar was back to normal. She was so excited. This lasted about 8 months. Then she got sick/flu/cold and her blood sugar shot up to 230 and BP increased to 170. This is where we went wrong. Instead of going back to a low dose of insulin and BP meds, she had to double the dosage of chromium to (1000mg twice a day). (We met with a naturopath and she recommended doubling again to 2,000 twice a day WHICH WE DID NOT DO) 4 months later we discovered that she had kidney failure stage 5. I suggested that she have a kidney biopsy, but her nephrologist was not helpful. Finally, we have found a Doctor that recommends kidney biopsy to try to determine what has caused her kidney failure. CONCLUSION: A moderate amount of chromium is wonderful (maybe 100 twice a day??? Ask your Doctor. I cannot diagnose, treat, cure or prescribe!). An excessive amount of GTF or Chromium picolinate can be toxic to kidneys and liver, especially with long term use. THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.","

"I use coconut oil for my skin. Instead of purchasing an expensive, scented, skin exfoliator, I take a gob of coconut oil and a teaspoon of brown sugar, rub in my hands and rinse. It's delightful.

I am a Holistic Health Coach in Washington state and I've been a healthy living advocate for at least 30 years. I don't understand this new trend with people using coconut oil for cooking.  Several years ago, massage therapists started to find their choloestral levels went sky high. They used cocounut oil for treatment, it was absorbed into their skin.  

I also don't find any supportive evidence that coconut oil, even though it is a ""medium chain"" fat, is actually doing any good. In one of my lectures, an instructor said that we should only take cocounut oil if it is combined with the actual coconut.

I decided to put Virgin Coconut oil on the leg sore and try to get some moisture to it...the next day her legs and ankles were normal people size. I was so in shock I couldnt believe it! I started putting a spoonful in our coffee once or twice a day, the swelling so far has not returned. In addition I was afraid she was developing alzheimers...Symptoms have disappeared. She has lost 20lbs of fluid from her legs. This stuff is amazing!!! Using it on my hair, skin, everywhere!","

This is a serious question. Is coconut oil that you would buy to eat okay to apply on extremities? I heard coconut oil moisturized the skin so I apply it every week or so generously after showering. As far as I know coconut oil contains a high level of saturated fat. Would that be unsafe in relation to libido health? I think saturated fat causes high cholesterol which may be bad for the male extremities...,"

"Vaginal Yeast Infection

As I age and my body changes (I'm 43), I've started having problems with yeast infections a few days before my period.  It goes away when my period arrives but it's a miserable 3 to 5 days so I'm not willing to just wait it out.  

Tired of paying for the OTC stuff and not having much luck with it anyway for instant relief, I decided to try coconut oil.

My spouse applied the coconut oil (unrefined, organic) topically to my vaginal area and mentioned that the very visible redness INSTANTLY went away and my skin color looked normal within seconds! 

The relief was also instant.  I used some internally as well.  

The itch did return the next day but the coconut oil again stopped it. 

The only downside is the mess. The coconut oil quickly melts due to body heat and ""runs all over"" so I found it was best to just give up with trying to do anything after applying it, and I put a towel under myself and just read in bed for a while. 

Four stars instead of five because it didn't ""cure"" the yeast issue but it stopped the maddening itch which is more than I could have asked for!

"I got scaly patches of stress psoriasis on my face that I keep peeling the dry skin off, exposing raw, red skin underneath. The patches appeared about two weeks ago. They may have been prompted by a sun-screen allergic reaction, and sun exposure, as well. I applied both a topical, over-the-counter antibiotic ointment, and organic raw coconut oil on separate occasions, alternately. The ointment did not relieve the scaly, dry patch, which kept returning. The coconut oil has been. The scaly top keeps reforming, but not as it had with the ointment. There is less for me to ""scratch and peel"" after the coconut oil works, so less raw skin from beneath results. I'll see a dermatologist to make sure I don't have actinic keratosis, but the coconut oil is working magic. I should also probably see a psychotherapist about my absolute inability to keep from picking off the dry, dead epidermis from the patches, knowing full well that raw, red, painful skin will result. :) In the meantime, the coconut oil is doing a good job of giving me relief.","

"My overall cholesterol was at 219 and my LDL came in at 160.8. for my last blood done in Aug. 2017.  I began taking coconut oil supplements beginning of Oct. 2017 and had more blood work done in Nov. 2017.  The results came back that my overall cholesterol had dropped down to 200, a lowering of 19 points and my LDL went from 160.8 down to 140, a difference of nearly 21 points.  I'd say that the fat in coconuts did not increase my cholesterol but in fact lowered it quite a bit.  I did not change my eating habits at all and all I did different was add coconut oil to my daily routine.  Over the last three years, my cholesterol never got below 207 overall, so I'd say taking coconut oil has benefited me very much...","

"As caregiver to an 89 year old Dementia/Ahlzeimer's patient I gave 2 1000 mg softgel's each day for less than a week. (Maybe 3-4 days.) The patient also had a personal history of diabetes (but no meds), high blood pressure, taking lovastatin for her heart, bleeding stomach ulcers and 3rd stage kidney disease. Her blood pressure fell dramatically. She became so weak and fatigued and dehydrated. We took her to emergency room where she was admitted. She was released days later to my care for HOSPICE. This basically killed her. She was my mother in law. One of her sons was the one who mentioned Coconut Oil for Ahlzeimer's. I used it in my cooking in moderation for about a week and then took it a step further and gave her the supplements. I am now being called a killer by her one son (my ex-husband). This stuff can be very dangerous by lowering blood pressure way too low and causing dehydration! I would never recommend it to anyone on any medication at all. Perhaps it should not be sold as a oral supplement at all! It was Meijer's brand supplement however I'm sure that the brand had nothing to do with the outcome.","

I recommend taking it on a full stomach and then eating a cracker to get the taste out of my mouth (Spring Valley, Norweigan Cod Liver Oil Natural and Artificial Orange Flavored)","

"I have been taking cod liver oil for six weeks now (high strength). I honestly don't know if my eyesight has improved because of this,  but for the first time in twenty years of wearing glasses I can now focus on normal distance things or when I am out walking. I even think I could safely drive without my glasses. I have begun to test myself reading number plates without my glasses with quite positive results. I still need to wear them for reading etc. But something has happened to improve my sight and I can only assume its the cod liver oil.

"My son was born with severe acid reflux. We tried everything from special formula, special diet for me when breastfeeding, prescription meds such as Prevacid and Zantac. Nothing worked. He even had to go through 2 endoscopies. The last medicine we tried when he was three made him worse. We started giving him 1/2 tsp. Nordic Naturals Cod Liver Oil  orange flavor, daily. He immediately decreased in reflux episodes and it eventually went away. In the last year plus, he has had only had a handful of episodes. Once was when I gave him pepperoni to see if he could now eat it. I call it a miracle remedy and only wish we knew about it sooner especially when he was 2 weeks old screaming in pain.

It was Friday night and we got her through with alternating Motrin and Tylenol every 2-3 hours until she fell asleep. She woke twice during the night with pain. Early Saturday morning, while I was debating a trip to the ER, my husband suggested colloidal silver.  I put about 1/3 of a dropper full in her ear and although she didn't like the cold, wet feeling, her earache subsided within hours and the fever was gone by the afternoon. She was completely fine the next day. We are currently using it to treat an outbreak of molluscum cantagiosum virus(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PM H0001829/) on her inner elbow and abdomen. The papules have shrunken significantly in size and the one that had previously popped is now flat and nearly healed. She has had these bumps for almost 2 months. everything I've read said they typically last for about 9 months before going away on their own (and that's if they don't pop and spread). I used tea tree oil at first; it smells awful and didn't do anything so, after the ear infection, I switched to CS. It's great stuff!","

"I use colloidal silver almost daily for everything from ear infections, sore throats, headaches, cuts, rashes, and recurring systemic fungal infections. I make my own and it has been a virtual miracle cure for me and my family. We also use it on our pets. I regularly consume 2-4 oz. per day for the last several years with absolutely no side effects. Our 3 year old grandson just had a stomach bug and we treated it with colloidal silver with excellent results. When anyone in our family gets sick, we rarely go to the doctor. We self-treat with sinus washes (warm salt water to remove mucus, followed by colloidal silver and iodine misting treatments) and sipping and swishing 2-6 oz. of colloidal silver per day at close intervals. I cured a 5 year chest infection with colloidal silver and iodine misting. I believe it could cure almost any lung and sinus infection including asthma. The only downside to using colloidal silver is that it is not very potent and must be used regularly and frequently to achieve the desired results. At pennies per gallon (home-made) this is easily accomplished. I use de-colorized iodine as a potent additive but this cannot be combined ahead of time. It can only be added at the time of treatment or it loses its effectiveness and oxidizes rapidly.","

For many years I have been making my own CS and taking it to help prevent and shorten my illnesses. I use both internally and externally. It's great for shortening the symptoms of a cold or flu...during the cold and flu season I take a couple of oz. a day. Great for athlete foot and jock itch. I just can't say enough good things in this short format.,"

"I realized I had the start of shingles one Friday night. The stinging and irritation was getting worse and worse. I was trying to think what I could do to relieve the pain when I remembered I had a bottle of colloidal silver in the back of the cabinet. My mom had given it to me a few years earlier. I started applying it and immediately I felt relief. I would have relief for about 1/2 an hour and then would apply it again. I wondered if cool water would give the same relief -- it did not. The silver was actually doing something to relieve the pain. I started taking it orally then, and continued to apply it to relieve the pain. I planned to go to the doctor on Monday morning, but by Monday the shingles were almost completely gone! That sold me. I now make my own colloidal silver and have used it to cure ear infections, sinus infections, pink eye, and sore throats. I use it on cuts and burns, insect bites, etc. Sometimes I add some to the rinse cycle of my laundry. It takes away the musty smell that sometimes is in the dishcloths and towels during the hot summer months. I LOVE colloidal silver!","

I use a 10-20 PPM solution, both internally and externally, for anything that I would be forced to otherwise use an antibiotic. I take it at the first sign of cold or flu and symptoms are gone within a day or two.  My cat had problems with urinary infections so I put a dropper or two in her water and she has not had any problems with infections since.  I have never had any negative side effects even when I take as much as 2-4 ounces per day during severe illness.  Personally I think it is a God-send.","

In Oct 2003 we have purchased a Micro-Particle Colloidal Silver Generator from The Silver Edge and began to make the Colloidal Silver at home for a very reasonable price - for about $1.50/Gallon!!!

"Following are the primary treatments I used that helped dramatically for my severe chronic skin infection, itchiness, and eczema:

I tried to leave Tea Tree Oil Ointment on thick for 24 hours or more, then I simply wiped-off the thick scaly-skin with a paper towel. I also used a ""Colloidal / ionic Silver-based Gel"" which stopped or dramatically reduced my severe skin infection within 1 or 2 days (available at many health stores). Previous attempts with a couple of rounds of prescription antibiotics failed at reducing my skin infection and the prescriptions actually made it worse due to severe itching allergic reactions. On the other hand, the ""Colloidal / ionic Silver-based Gel"" worked almost immediately at reducing and eliminating severe chronic skin infection and itching on both my arms. Currently, you can search on youtube for ""Sovereign Silver First Aid Gel"" see before and after videos of my arms.
After much of the thick scaly-skin was off, I used a Neem and Lactobacillus-based topical cream. It is not easy to find Neem-based creams that also have the topical probiotic Lactobacillus. However, I would guess that a cream may be created by simply adding some of the probiotic in powder-form from health stores to widely available Neem-based creams. I used ""Episencial Soothing Cream"" (a topical Neem and Lactobacillus Cream with lots of other natural ingredients included) and you can currently find it online. You should also be able to find the ""Sovereign Silver First Aid Gel"" online and in many local health stores.
My guess as to why this topical Probiotic Neem cream was very effective at reducing or eliminating the itchiness and eczema for me is as follows: I have heard we all have bacteria on our skin naturally.  I'm guessing that adding this ""good"" probiotic bacteria topically may help eliminate the ""bad"" bacteria on our skin.
This skin condition had been a chronically severe problem for me for many months until I came across these natural products and methods.","

"I have used CS for various reasons using various methods - Orally, Body Spray and Nasal Spray. In my case, it worked great  for colds, shortness of breath and crotch itch to name a few. The last time I went to the doctor and a chest xray was performed, I was informed that I had slight emphysema. I also did pretty poorly on my Lung Function Test. I found that after using CS my shortness of breath had improved nicely allowing me to breathe much more deeply and fully. This past winter, I have warded off colds as they started (sniffles, sneezing, coughing, etc.). Previously, colds were very serious for me as I have suffered from lung cancer a number of years ago and had a right upper lobectomy to remove the cancer. My stamina as well as weakness in my legs has also improved which may be a result of walking more than previously. Before taking CS it was a challenge because my lung and legs used to scream for oxygen when going up hills which cut down on my motivation for walking. Now, I enjoy it but not when it's too hot. As far as crotch itch, I spray the area as soon as the itch starts. Usually, stops the itch right away and I usually forget about it. If it continues afterwards, another session or two does the trick. Every winter past, except for this last one, I would get extremely dry itchy skin on my lower legs. I would scratch my legs while awake or asleep to the point of rawness. This past winter, I avoided this scenario by spraying CS on my legs. It would stop the itch. I would do this several times as whatever causes this condition needed a little more to conquer it. I've had great success with sore gums. There are many uses for CS but the above is my experience of handling certain conditions. From my experience, I can truthfully say it has helped me a great deal. I really love this stuff and what it has done for me. I have both purchased commercially and have made my own CS.","

"We not only use Colloidal Silver in our Electrolytes for foot baths when treating Peripheral Neuropathy, and have found very positive results when treating Diabetic Ulcers, but we take it internally ourselves as well - we do not primarily promote it, however and are not in the business of marketing Colloidal Silver.  Last year, we were able to run a small test with several of our patients as well as ourselves whom came down with Swine Flu.  Half of our group drank and/or ""inhaled"" CS mist and the other half did nothing but try traditional flu remedies. Those of us using the Colloidal Silver had the flu on the average of two to four days only.  Those who did not, continued their flu symptoms on the average of 10 to 60 days; with the longer period of time being secondary symptoms which developed from the flu.  Is it for everyone?  No, certainly not - just as one medication is not right for everyone.  Can it be ""overdone?""  Certainly - just as taking to much of ANY substance even water, can have detrimental effects.  And, is there a lot of ""misinformation"" or ""poor grade"" products out there for the consumer to avoid - most certainly!  But, contrary to popular belief, there have been clinical studies done which show Colloidal Silvers effectiveness - or else, we would not use it.  When in doubt, always ask your doctor - but remember, he/she is most likely untrained in this particular substance.  So, considering that, refer to an expert on the subject.  But worrying about what might be ""politically correct"" should never be an option in health care. In our opinion, purchase ONLY safe, quality products, take as directed as any other over the counter product and just like any other product, if it doesn't work for you seek out something else which will!","

"I have been sick for 6months with sinus problems. My ears, throat, and sinus hurt, and I felt like I was choaking. Every time I went to the doctor they would give me antibiotic, but as soon as they were gone it would come back. I event went to a ENT and he told me that he couldnt find anything wrong. That was after he did a CT scan ( which cost me an arm and a leg). He told me that he thought it was acid refulx. PLEASE. When I told the Pharmaist what he said he looked and me funny and told me that didnt sound right. (I think The ENT just wanted my money). Any way, When I got back from my appointment with the ENT,I was so upset and down hearted. I didnt know what else to do. My neighbor told me about the wonderful collidal sliver. He had some that he gave me to try. As soon as I got in the house I tried some. With in 5 mins I felt better. I have been using it for 3 days and all my symoptoms and all most gone. I honestly dont know what I would have done with out it. It has been a life life saver literally.My daughter also tried it as she has sinus problems also,and she is also feeling better.

Ha, ha, take that drug company servants and minions, you serve your masters well, but colloidal silver is completely effective for dozens of illnesses. HA!

Everytime I get the sick feeling in my throat, in which I swallow and a pain in throat announces another sore throat is on the way, I spray colloidal silver with a mister into my mouth several times, and several times a day, it goes away. I haven't had a sore throat since I started using it. It can also be sprayed up nose.

There were times when it got so bad I had to use crutches,  my feet would crack and bleed just by walking on them. Using colloidal silver 1oz in the am and 1 oz in the pm has cured me. I noticed healing in the first week and within 1 month it was completely gone. Eczema free for almost a year now. A side bonus has been my joints no longer hurt and swell, my Dr told me it was arthritis. As an electrician I kneel alot and the pain and stiffness made my job very difficult at times. Its so nice not to have the pain and swelling. My family and friends use colloidal silver for everything with awesome results. I bought my machine at the silver edge.com and it has really made a hugh difference in our lives. My whole families quality of life has been changed since using colloidal silver.","

I am a recent user of colloidal silver and I make my own at home because it's so hard to find.  I had been suffering with bleeding gums (even when not brushing) for some months and my dentist's recommendations and regular cleanings had not worked.  I began using the CS about 2 weeks ago and I cannot believe how much my gums have improved. I still have some slight bleeding when I brush too hard or floss but nothing like it was before and I'm confident that I will see more improvement in future.  My husband tells me my breath is so much fresher now too.
We've started using CS for other things now - cuts, burns, sore eyes and I am very happy to have found this wonderful product that I can make myself.","

"I am shocked that the article speaks in fact that colloidal silver is ineffective. You can't be serious. About 10 years ago, my son was 6 years old and began having swollen lymph nodes all over his neck. I spent 6K on doctors visits and antibiotics and would be told my son was ""fine"" although the lymph nodes continued to swell. After 10 months one lymph node on his neck was so swollen my son could not even hold his head up straight. I had found a new doctor to get answers and had an appt scheduled when my father suggested a local doc who used alternative treatments. I was terrified my son had cancer. I took him in to my father's doc and he had a look at him and then told him to drink the ""magic water""...colloidal silver of course. By that evening the lymph node that had only continued to swell for 10 months felt mushy to the touch. The doc had given me a second bottle which I gave my son on day two. Within 3 days he was back to normal. I did take my son to the new doctor on day 4 just in case...a blood smear found my son had mono but I was questioned as to what he had been taking as much of the virus was dead. Ha! This is only ONE story of many I could tell you...but colloidal silver IS effective. Ignore the hype","

"I am 31 and was diagnosed with polyps in my nasal cavities 3yrs ago! I had a clear uncontrollable watery runny drip from my right nostril everyday several times a day. I tried many antibiotics and nasal sprays nothing worked. I also had a bad smell from this. I started making my own silver about a year ago and started first off with the nasal spray. WOW after about using 4 times a day for just 3 days NO more drip. No more carrying around a tissues or wiping on my shirt. I also have 3 kids and have used for flu, colds, stomach aches, tooth aches, rashes, poison ivy, cuts and everything in between. This stuff works wonders not kidding. Just as a side not make sure you properly make and use as with any medication over use or in proper mix can have bad side effects...but when done right it works great. I make a 15 ppm batch with just distilled water...no additives no flavors no mixing just DISTILLED water and silver and of course 2 nine volt batteries. I have passed the cure around to family and friends and some call it a miracle. A friend of mine has Hep C and wanted to start taking and after 3 months of 1 ounce a day he went back to have blood work done and his count was down by something like from 3 million to 550,000. But I have so many stories from other people that use it to like my sister that had Atopic dermatitis (Eczema)whenever she got stressed out or random break outs she applied topically and gone just like magic. I hope everyone knows the truth about silver and dont believe you are going to turn blue because you wont again if taking proper dosage, proper mixture and no overdosing as with any meds. No stronger the 15 ppm is plenty. Thank you all and stay safe!    ","

"Shame on you WebMD.com! According to the Merck Pharmaceuticals website, they have paid you more than $3.5 million between 2008 and 2012. 
How can we trust your statements regarding the safety and efficacy of non-prescription supplements if you are being so strongly influenced by the drug companies?
A recent letter sent to the FDA requested:
The number of deaths, allergic reactions and harmful drug interactions related to the use of colloidal silver. 
In response to this request, a letter from Hal Stepper, Freedom of Information Staff HFD-205, stated, “We have searched the records from FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) and have been unable to locate any cases that would be responsive to your request.”
The FDA itself ADMITS they have nothing on which to base their statements that colloidal silver is unsafe. Colloidal silver has never killed anyone, in some 120 years of continuous use. 
On the other hand, the AERS demonstrates that 145,000 children or more have died over the past 20 years as a result of adverse effects from childhood vaccinations. 
WebMD.com goes on to say that: 
“People who produce colloidal silver at home will likely not be able to evaluate their product for purity or strength."" 
This is also blatantly untrue!!  Colloidal silver made using distilled water and .9999 pure silver is virtually 100% pure, with only a 0.0001 possibility of contamination and its strength is easily evaluated and quantified using a parts-per-million water tester widely available for less than $20. 
Amazing! As per the FDA itself, colloidal silver use has resulted in NO reported deaths, allergic reactions, or harmful drug interactions. On the other hand, every antibiotic produced by the pharmaceutical companies has had NUMEROUS reported deaths, allergic reactions, and harmful drug interactions yet WebMD.com continues to vilify colloidal silver and glorify antibiotics and drugs produced by the pharmaceutical companies padding their bottom line.

"I have been using colloidal silver (generated with the microparticle generator from THE SILVER EDGE) to successfully eliminate the chronic sinus infections which plagued me for over 20 years. In the past, seasonal allergies and colds set off 3 to 4 serious sinus infections per year. The typical treatment was a trip to the doctor for prescription antibiotics and steroids. The steroids caused weight gain, and the antibiotics caused chronic stomach problems. Approximately 5 years ago, I began using colloidal silver to treat my sinus issues. In the time since I started using colloidal silver to treat this condition, I have only been to the doctor once for a sinus infection. I haven't ""turned gray"" or experienced any bad side effects whatsoever. After successfully using the silver to treat my sinus issues, I started using it as a mouthwash to overcome periodontal disease. Within weeks after using it, my chronic gum inflammation completely cleared up. My dentist determined the surgical cleaning procedure recommended under my gums would no longer be necessary. When I developed a bacterial rash on my face, my doctor prescribed an antibacterial product called Metrogel, which I used for eight months, to no avail. I decided to use colloidal silver in a spray form to treat this infection. It cleared up in less than a month.  I am delighted with this product, which has personally saved me hundreds of dollars worth of medications and doctor's visits, and which has greatly improved the quality of my life. I have found this product to be very safe and highly effective.  I plan to continue using it indefinitely.","

"My husband and I have used Colloidal Silver for years for almost all types of infections and wellness care needs.  We ALWAYS have positive results in record time.  We use it in our ears, eyes, as an oral rinse to prevent plaque and tartar buildup, on ""sore"" spots that won't go away with other topical treatments bought over-the-counter...the list is so long I don't have enough space here to continue.  We have NEVER had an adverse reaction and don't understand why anyone would say otherwise.  We wouldn't be without it and since we can produce our own ""silver water"" at home it costs pennies to stay well and healthy.

"I have been using colloidal silver for several years and I would not be caught without it. I used to get very sick every single winter with strep throat and since taking colloidal silver on a regular basis, I NEVER get strep throat anymore.  I do occasionally get a cold or something but it never lasts as long as it used to.  When I have a cut, open wound, I always put colloidal silver directly on or in the wound with no fear whatsoever that something is going to go wrong.  I know the silver is going to kill the germs and bacteria and the wound always heals very quickly and most of the time without any scare tissue.  It helps my eyes feel better and clears up any itching or scratching in my eyes, I breath it into my lungs and I feel much better in a short time.  Since I drink colloidal silver on a daily basis, I hardly even get sick anymore.  It helps my little dog as well.  Anyone who says that colloidal silver does NOT help their health issues probably have not given it a fair try.  I could go on and on about the wonderful benefits I and others in my family have experienced but there just isn't enough time or room here for me to do it.  The bottom line is this...  IT WORKS LIKE A MIRACLE!  PERIOD!!","

"I was given an antibiotic and 3 RXs w/steroids to treat sinusitis. These turned into a FUNGAL SINUITIS. Using 500 ppm Colloidal Silver via Neti pot rinse began healing with 24 hours. I also used 9 ppm Colloidal Silver drops to eyes and after ear candling, in my ears. Not only has the infection gone but my ears hear better than in years. I had so side effects. My care was overseen by a highly recognized ENT in Washington DC. 
I highly recommend it as safe and effective and am dismayed FDA allows pharmaceutical companies to research using this same product in patches charging $9 per patch to heal skin boils and surface infections. Shame on greed. Consumers should be made aware of this affordable safe effective treatment available over the counter.

I am extremely happy with the results with colloidal silver for many uses. I have to be ultra careful not to get sick at all due to COPD.  I also use it to ward off dental abscess, infections from skin breaks, styes etc.  I haven't even had a cold in 3 years when everyone else is sick. I use it the moment I think I'm getting anything and the next morning I'm FINE!  Big Pharma HATES things we can use without THEM. 

ALSO,Merck's charitable foundation, the John Merck Fund, helped provide millions of dollars in funding to radical environmental activist groups (created by the U.N.) working to force the EPA to regulate nanosilver as a ""pesticide"" and take antimicrobial silver products off the market.

The DR ordered another blood test, again it confirmed he did not have MRSA in his blood.

CS is very effective compared to pharma antibiotics.

I stopped it and turned to colloidal silver, in 24 hours time i was up and about.  For cystitis with DMSO, it cleared me of pain and discomfort in 4 hours time!

I have stopped colds, athletes foot, sty and eye infections, skin infections, bladder infections, stopped diverticulitis attacks and many other issues. I have used it with animals too. I see most peoples negativity around CS as uneducated and narrow minded. They are afraid of turning blue, which happens when one takes a LOT or poorly made CS, but it does not happen over night. It usually means that the CS has been over taken or abused. I suggest that they try taking the entire prescription of antibiotic all at once and see how that works. How sick will you  get when you overdose or abuse pharmaceutical meds? People die from medications every day. CS is safe when taken properly and made correctly.","

A week and half after that 10 days regimen, another red hot patch showed up on her stomach. I had vented to my massage therapist and he told me about colloidal silver. He has been using it for about 10 years with success. I realized I had heard of it before from my grandma years ago. I had already ordered it and thankfully it had arrived before her stomach patch appeared. To be honest, I was pretty skeptical. I first saw the patch in the evening around 8pm. I saturated her skin with the colloidal silver and gave her a TBLSP orally. I checked it again at midnight, thinking nothing would have changed, and the patch was about half the size as it had been earlier. I proceeded to do the same thing every 3-4 hours and by noon the next day, it was gone. Totally shocked, amazed and ecstatic. If I can prevent her from being on heavy antibiotics 3x a year, then that will save her gut and immune system. ","

"I have had great luck with Colloidal Silver.  Before even trying it I bought a Silver Lungs Generator.  My son got reoccurring staph infections, and the doctors were not able to help at all.  I had read that Colloidal Silver would cure staph infection. I have not had a chance to try it on staph, but have used it for ear infections, eye infections, and my mother used it for a tooth ache that she's had for years.  It helped clear up all this problems.  Also, my son ended up with a rash that we believe was caused by poison ivy.  He had little red bumps on the back of his neck and some had white heads on them.  We first noticed them and I decide to try the Colloidal Silver on the rash.  It has now been three days and it is clearing up.  After the first time I used it on him I noticed a difference immediately.  After day two there were no more white heads.  It's not completely gone, but Colloidal Silver is so amazing!!  ","

"I am a true believer in the healing properties of Silver!  Just like copper, magnesium, iron and selenium are essential metals needed for cell function in the human body - silver has been proven effective over hundreds of years to assist with health and healing.  After years of chemicals and antibiotic treatments for cancer and resulting health problems, I was literally ""sick to death"" of the strictly pharmaceutical solutions which were keeping me sick.  I have spent the last 10yrs building my own treatments, researching alternative and natural solutions which help build the bodies natural immunity and also eliminating ALL chemicals in my body and home.  Silver is a staple of my treatment.  I use it for every ailment via any method, meaning all internal and external uses you could imagine.  It is safe enough for use directly in the eye, nasal & ear canals and open wounds.  It works miracles for common animal wounds as well...  I've even used it in puppies sick with Parvo and I believe that is what healed them in just 5 days.  My 3 1/2 year old grandson uses it regularly also and despite attending preschool, has NEVER been sick a day in his life.
It BLOWS my mind that the FDA will defend the use of dangerous antibiotics, even with the resulting antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria, but won't get behind the use of Silver - even though they can't produce one example of a ""silver related death"" or even one negative complication when silver was taken as directed.","

" Works for mrsa. Dose dependent. Refer to Dr.Robert O Beckers work. Used it with my mother. And as a disinfectant. Works for herpes. I haven't had an outbreak for 2 years.  Stopped taking valtrex. I've used it in a nebulizer to break up mucous. Works, but I wouldn't recommend as I've seen pros and cons listed on the internet. Works for sores and things of that nature quickly. I had a chemical reaction to hair dye once. Had no effect on that. Had to get a steroid shot. I make my own colloidal silver. 10 ppm. No set dosage. Some days I may drink a half cup, other days a cup, or a pint. Other days none at all. Will always try this before conventional drugs.

My eyes tear heavily, which leads to wet lids, causing intense burning, swelling, itching, and welts at its high points. The ophthalmologist wants me to take antibiotics for the rest of my life, which improves the condition but not completely (and who wants to do that to their body?).  Well, I ran out of the antibiotics 2 weeks ago & haven't been able to get the refill. Today, the health food store suggested colloidal silver. I've put one drop in each eye 8 hrs apart and rubbed the liquid on my lids.  INSTANT relief.  Not even my $400 eye drops stopped the tearing. My eyes haven't teared all day and my beet red, thick swollen lids are calming down rapidly. Amazing.  I can't wait to see what they look like in a few days.

"No, it's NOT a miracle treatment. Don't be misled by hundreds of positive testimonies here depicting CS as a ""wonder antibiotic"". In retrospect I should have been suspicious when I read all the positive reviews here b4 buying my own silver machine, 'cos most of them rated for the ""Ease of Use"" at 5 stars --- but how can it be 5 stars when u have to make it urself with a dedicated machine, each time for hours, let alone all the careful washing beforehand!!!? But I didn't ha ha... foolish me :D

However, not that I'm saying I regret buying the machine, no, no, it's a good investment I think (mine is SilverLung btw).  All am saying is it is not as miraculous as spammers here would like u to believe.

From my experience, CS is GREAT for mild scald/burn  and cuts (haven't suffered any more severe ones since acquiring the machine (touching wood), so no experience); absolutely great, takes care of the pain in no time --- well, ok, this by itself is quite miraculous :)  Also, quite good for otitis externa, but needs to spray it for several times a day. I have vitiligo patches, which can become hypersensitive to the sun/UV after medication is applied on them, when that happens they become super itchy and disturb sleep --- CS takes care of it well, but might need to re-spray near morning. In short, unexpectedly I find it to be a good pain and itch killer for skin lesions!

But it is NOT effective for treatment or prevention of acne. Okay for folliculitis (infection of hair follicle). I haven't taken it internally so far.  And that's about all I have tried it for so far. Good luck!","

He is also better. His eyes are clear and he keeps them open now , where he was squinting and bumping into everything before the C.S.  I will use this treatment first from now on for most illnesses. Than if it doesn't work I will seek out the Vet or Dr. I already know it will save me a bundle. ","

"I have been suffering with sinus infections for 25 years now seeing specialist after specialist,  on antibiotics every month once even for a solid year,  have had sinus surgery, use a neti pot, and nothing has stopped the infections.   A friend has been after me for years to try colloidal silver mixed with peppermint oil in a spray/pump bottle like used for saline nasal spray.   For the FIRST time I have been sinus infection free for 2 months.   When I ran out of CS for over a week the infection returned.   She brought me another bottle and told me to spray it in my nostrils every time I think about it.  In two days no more yellow from my nose,  facial pain is gone,  and no more fever.   I was reluctant to try it because of the NIH claims against it but now I am considering purchasing my own CS generator.   This has been the only thing that has helped after all the years of antibiotics, sinus cleansing in the doctors' offices, sinus surgery,  and my neti pot.  I'm still in disbelief but there is no other explanation. ","

"I love to read the web MD reviews on ANYTHING alternative.  I have worked in healthcare for over 17 years and I have a master's degree in nursing, so I KNOW about medical and health related research- I take it ALL with a grain of salt because 90% of it is Pharma funded and biased. Now, onto colloidal silver.  Not sure why it is knocked so hard here.  In allopathic (or mainstream medicine) it is readily used to treat severe wounds and has been for ages.  It is really a ""go to"" treatment in that realm.  
I agree with using it under supervision and for specific reasons by someone who is highly trained and educated.  I use it intermittently when I get a cold to avoid a sinus infection, steroids (which mess up your immune system) and antibiotics (which also mess up your immune system), and it IS effective.  I never have to use it for more than a few days.  I use it under the direction and supervision of my primary MD, who is board certified in family practice.  Go out and find an allopathic MD that practices Functional medicine and they will not lead you astray! ","

"My dog got bitten by another dog around his neck area at the dog park about a month and a half ago. I took him to the vet and he got stitches as well as antibiotics and an anti inflamatory. The medicine worked well until about 10 days when it ran out. After a couple of days a horrible infection set on. We took him back to the vet and they opened up the incision, cleaned out the area and put in some drains to get rid of all the pus around his neck. They prescribed some more meds. It healed along fine until it ran out. Then the whole nightmare started all over again four a couple more times. By then I was desperate to be done with this whole ordeal. I paid the vet over $1,100 and nothing was working. Then I did some research online and found colloidal silver. I had nothing to lose. I had to try something different. I found it at GNC for about $26. I followed the instructions on the bottle and administered it both orally and topically. After only a week my dog's infection is  about 90% gone! I don't usually write reviews but in this instance I think it could perhaps help someone in a similar situation desperate to find relief. This works on humans as well as animals. It is an incredible treatment for a skin infrction in my experience!","

"I read a lot about colloidal silver and I am surprised by the amounts of information and different colloidal silver products, so I did my research and got involved with the product. I have a professional friend in the field who has research it for over 20 years. To keep it short, it does not kill 650 organisms, it does not cure it all, colloidal silver is not a colorless liquid, the make-it-at-home kits do not make quality colloidal silver. Here is the truth, there is a list of about 105 uses since the early 1900s, it does work on many bacteria (some are silver resistant surprisingly), it works on some virus but it is size dependent (meaning different particle sizes act on different virus in different ways) and it has a color to it, yellow to red to gray to green, it all depends on many factors, the simple ones to understand are particles size and particle concentration and these 2 are very important because if you use the wrong kind then the long term side effects can turn you grayish blue. Do I use it? of course! I have actually cured my strep throat many times in only 3 days by using a finger sprayer every 20 minutes, but the kind I use is from Silver Living Tech because I can see the product in their clear bottle before I buy it and they include a finger spray bottle with my orders (www.silverlivingtech.com is their website).
I have used it for coughs, for sinus infections, for allergy relief, for the flu, and every time I use it in intervals of 20 minutes, 1-3 sprays. So word of advise, do your research, understand what colloidal means and then buy smart. ","

True silver colloids will have a value of Percent of nanoparticles that exceeds 50 percent. Without the detailed laboratory analysis described above there is no way of knowing if a product is really true colloidal silver. Most companies advertising their product as true colloidal silver today don't have a clue what the percent of nanoparticles is for the product they are selling.

I was told she may be becoming asthmatic as well.  We were sent home with a puffer which helped temporarily. I had already been researching colloidal silver but was hesitant to try it.  Then I discovered water damage under my kitchen sink from a water filter system I installed.  A line had a drip long enough to damage the bottom of the sink basin and had soaked through the wall into my front living room.  I pulled the couch away from the wall and discovered black mold.  I immediately ordered 15ppm colloidal silver nasal spray and administered it to my son as soon as i got it in the afternoon (2 shots up each nostril) then again before bed.  Again the next morning before school, again after school, and again before bed that night. HIS COUGH WAS GONE after that!!  Nothing else worked.  That was when he was in the 1st grade.  He is now in the 4th grade and hasn't missed a day of school or been sick since!!  Mold is known to cause asthma.  Colloidal silver is known to kill mold.

"My grandpa was suffering from an enlarged prostate. He tried different drugs but all with lots of bleeding and other problems. I told him about colloidal silver (I use Super Tyndall Effect colloidal silver by Silver Living Tech). I helped him flush it through his catheter 2ice daily. When he started he could not pee without the catheter. 4 months later he was able to pee without a catheter (he still needs the catheter sometimes). I also bought a lot of it for him to drink it along with the flushing treatment (about 15 cups of 15 ppm daily, although my grandma would forget to give him all 15 and sometimes gave him only 2 or 3 a day). I think if he would have drank the 15 cups he would be much better now, but he still had improvement. He is feeling much better, happier because the catheter is not as needed, and we will see what happens in another 4 months. He is starting other treatments though because unfortunately insurances don't cover colloidal silver and it can get a bit pricey.","

"CS DOES work if you are using the correct type. There are 3 types: ionic silver, silver protein, and true colloidal silver. If your skin is turning blue or grey, you are not using the correct type of CS, and may cause harm to yourself. You are using a ""CS"" using silver protein--which you should NOT use. 

When I use CS, I use a TRUE CS, and second choice is ionic CS. There is so much to explain about CS that I will direct you to a website that does testing of different and explains CS in depth--how it works, etc. Here's the website: silver-colloids.com

I use Source Naturals Wellness Colloidal Silver 30ppm. An example for you: I had a filling that cracked and ended up in major pain. I used an antibiotic for 15 days with minimal relief (it SHOULD have zapped my infection a few days in!). Don't know why I didn't think of CS right away. I used a gauze pad which I put over the tooth, then added enough CS to saturate the gauze (about a teaspoon). I left it in place, not swallowing (wanted the CS to stay in my mouth), for about 20 minutes. Then I just swallowed the CS. I repeated this 2-3 times a day. By the beginning of the 3rd day, NO MORE PAIN. I did continue until the 4th day. I'm pain free 4 months later. :)

So what a lot of people, including whoever wrote this article, unless they choose a true (or ionic) colloidal silver, they are going to see minimal to NO effect. And they will most likely turn blue or grey too.

Bottom line: In order for a CS to be effective, you MUST choose the right type; true or ionic (I prefer 'true'), and avoid those that contain silver proteins like the plague. I'm also not sold on do-it-yourself CS generators. So just me, but I avoid CS made that way too.","

"First started the use of CS for our cats many years ago to clear up ringworm...after having tried so many other things to treat them and the next step being shaving them all bald, we gave it a try. The CS cleared up every one of their infections within a few days.  I have since used it topically and internally for my family and pets for years to heal wounds, mouth sores, sore throats, UTI's, eye infections, sinus infections, bronchitis, all which clear up within short amount of time with no other meds being used.  I know it works.  With the birth of my second baby I noticed she (having to be in daycare) was coming home sick every other day.  Dropping her off seeing runny noses from other kids it pained me to see the dreaded cycle...8 rounds of antibiotics prescribed to her last year alone.  She had the flu twice (with a flu shot), bronchitis, several ear infections, RSV, pink eye, roseola, the list goes on.  Fed up and wanting her to stay well, I started her on the CS 2 months ago and she hasn't been back to the doc even once.  I see snotty noses from her peers at her school, but she stays healthy each day never getting sick.  I believe in this product with all of my heart and will continue to sing it's praises as the proof is in the pudding! My family and I are over 10 years using it off and on as issues arise and we will continue to do so, since it far exceeds the crappy treatments our doctors are handing us.  Plus, it's tasteless, odorless and can be used in eyes and ears and scrapes with no pain so I don't have to chase my children around to FORCE them to use it because they aren't afraid to take it.

"Our new puppy, late on vaccinations, contracted the ""PARVO"" virus and when we took her to the vet, they recommended hospitalization with IV liquid and antibiotics for one week with costs of over $2000.00 and said chances were 80% that she was going to die anyways. We did not have the finances to cover the treatment and the Vet said to take her home and make her comfortable and she would have only about 24 hours left before she would die. We left in tears and when we got home, my girlfriend remembered a bottle of Nutra Silver that I had bought previously and she remembered the many cures this concentrated form of coladial silver was capabal of and wondered if it would help our puppy. We figured if she was gonna die anyways, what harm could it do? Donna got on the internet and started researching and found out that the Nutra Silver would actually kill the Parvo Parasite disease and wipe it out entirely instead of allowing the dog's immunity system to build against it, which is the treatment normally by vets. I started with one dropper full and almost immediately she stopped vomiting and bleeding. Four hours later I gave her another full dropper. After the third dose at 12 hours, she was eating and drinking again and within 24 hours, you could not even tell she had been sick. The most amazing thing we ever saw. Our dog still lives today, extremely healthy. Silver is the best and always will be...!!!","

"Colloidal silver has worked wonders for me. Helped my stomach ulcers, IBS, cavities, sinus issues, even a nasty stomach bug. My silver is stripped using a generator and is in some of the smallest form you can find it. The main reason, in my qualified nursing opinion, that the FDA has not approved this is because big pharma would go broke if everyone used this. It literally helps with every ailment, especially the things that people spend billions of dollars a year on antibiotics for. People that say it's ineffective or it's turned them blue- your probably weren't taking the right colloidal silver. Yes, there is a right one- electrically stripped silver in water stored in glass. It's expensive, so most people don't think that buying the costlier one is worth it- but then again, the cheap stuff does not work and that's probably why you're having problems. Also, my grandmother used to regularly get bronchitis, the flu at least once a year, multiple sinus issues, stomach bugs- the works. Since taking this product daily she has not been sick. I've given some to friends for cold sores and it heals within two days. This is a miracle product and pharmaceutical companies know that- which is why they have deemed it unsafe- not for people, but for their business.
Side note: mine is made by my doctor, in his office, by his generator- I do not buy online or purchase from stores, you don't always know what you are getting with that and he gives me a phenomenal price.","

"talk about a completely dishonest review. Shame on you WebMD. In order to actually get blue skin according the to world health organization, you would have to ingest at least 10 GRAMS of silver. The typical does is just less than 30 parts per MILLION. In other words the threat of blue skin is for all practical purposes a lie. Silver has been successfully and widely used for hundreds of years as one of the most effective treatments for a wide variety of health issues all over the world. Why do places like the WebMD and the AMD lie about and attempt to discredit colloidal silver? Simple: it can't be patented, it has little or no side effects when taken in proper therapeutic dosage, it actually works, and people can make it at home for a nominal cost. There have been endless studies conducted supporting the use of Colloidal silver. There is also of course hundreds of years of actual use. Most patented drugs on the market today can't make those claims. ","

My friend was telling me that he's used this product to treat various sores around his body by using the topical form of this. However he is also considered using it orally for other conditions because if it works on a cut he believes I must work on everything else. There are lots of treatments that will work on your skin but could probably poison you if you take them internally. The fact of the matter is silver as a noble metal it's probably not something you should be ingesting. This antidotal evidence that is posted on his website is proof of the placebo effect and the luck of many many idiots out there who are taking a product that could potentially kill them in the long run,"

"i had a terrible poison ivy/oak rash all over my body (face, chest, hips, thighs, and arms/hands).Treated by MD with prednisone injection plus orals and topical cortisone plus Aveeno baths. After two weeks, I developed what I believe is a fungal infection which was worse than the rash. I felt like my skin had been removed and i had immense swelling to my hips and thighs. i gained 7 pounds of fluid and could barely walk. I could only sleep with Benadryl. bc of the holidays and weekend, i couldn't see my doctor until Monday. I was so desperate and thought it was fungal, I looked for some Lotrimin but couldn't find any in the cabinet. I did find some Colloidal Silver 10ppm that my husband had bought a couple of years ago. When he bought it, I was highly skeptical but I sprayed it on in desperation due to the pain and irritation. I used my forearm as a test site.  In ten minutes my forearm was clearer and I sprayed it again. I walked the dog for 15 minutes and the rash on my forearm was gone. I sprayed it on my shoulders, hips, thighs, and knees with relief in about 30 minutes. Of course, the swelling has not subsided in this immediate period but, I am confident that it will be gone soon enough. I left my chest unsprayed as a test and it continues to be red, swollen, painful, and itching. Even though WebMD has poo pooed colloidal silver, my personal experience is that it has saved me from the pain and suffering I experienced after following doctor's orders. And, please know, I don't dislike doctors or have an axe to grind. My father practiced medicine for 50 years and my brother and niece continue the family tradition. I just know they don't know everything. ","

"I am considering blocking WebMD entirely.  When it comes to biology and chemistry there are known facts that cannot be disputed. The article states: "" How does it work? Colloidal silver can kill certain germs by binding to and destroying proteins."" Then goes on to state there are no know uses for CS.   To have what is considered a reputable medical site mix truth and lies because they prefer to have the government's approval over the health of their readers is disturbing at least and irresponsible at best.  

I know several uses WebMD.  Here are just  a few examples of how I use nanosilver and the successful results I experience. 

I used CS on my cat's facial abscess and it healed in the course of 5 days with no outer intervention, no surgery or drain tubes   Not only did the wound completely heal and the skin grow back but the HAIR grew back as well.  Anyone with pets knows this doesn't happen when surgery and FDA meds are involved. 

I have sinus issues from time to time. I use the silver and in 24hours the pain and swelling go down and in 3-5 days I an completely well. Everytime.  

I use it on my neighbor's dogs, two labs who get ear infections, and in 12 hours the inflammation is gone.  

My point is I know it works.
 
I'm frustrated to find the ridiculous statements in this article dissuading people who might otherwise be able to form their own opinion as well.  If you aren't allergic to silver, ask your doctors before hand if they have objections to you trying it on something simple: a inflamed cuticle or skin abrasion. I guarantee your doctor will say ""it's not going to hurt you to try"" and then you will see first hand the amazing quality of silver in the biological environment.  My doctor actually uses the silver water I make her.

As far as WebMD goes, you should be ashamed.  The article is so contradictory because you can only word a lie so many ways before the truth becomes apparent.","

"I supplemented with CLA twice, for six weeks and eight weeks respectively. The first time it was extremely effective, the second time not at all. The only differing variable was the workout regiment. It seems CLA only has the desired effects desired when paired with INTENSE exercise. I incorporated CLA into my annual teardown (transition from rugby to marathon/freediving season) and found the results to be astounding so long as I was exercising 6x weekly at 95% of MaxHR cardio (3x week) and 85% of MaxHR during resistance. Obviously this workout has dramatic results either way, with CLA my energy was better my lean muscle mass improved 14% better adn my bodyfat % dropped below 8 for the only time in my life. This intensity level is one that most people cannot achieve so in my opinion CLA is best used by high level athletes in peak training (I can only muster this about 4-10 weeks per year) ","

"CLA is not a miracle diet pill for people looking for instant weight loss. It works very well with a combination of a proper diet and exercise but unlike weight loss pills, CLA promotes muscle growth at the same time. With the combination of muscle growth and fat loss, it may not appear that you are losing weight immediately since muscle weighs more than fat. I highly recommend using CLA if you are a person who is committed to exercising and eating healthy. Again, if you think simply taking this pill on it's own will benefit your weight, you will be disappointed. ","

"I have noticed more fat loss than actual weight loss, which is fine by me! It could be because CLA increases lean muscle mass. And, since even at rest,a pound of muscle burns more fat than a pound of fat, increasing your lean muscle mass helps you burn more calories. So I'm burning more calories and losing more fat. I'm sure the results would be even better if I incorporated more exercise. Right now, I have been inconsistently walking around my apartment complex (1 round only) 2-3 times per week. Before CLA, walking would help me lose maybe 1 pound in a 2 week period.  Then, I'd gain it right back. Not with CLA!

"I was diagnosed with Pulmonary Fibrosis in late 2009, after being treated by another physician for COPD for several yrs.  

I had long been a believer of nutritional supplements.  A family member who is also a physician interested in supplements advised me to use Cordyceps and ALA.  My Pulmonary physician also put me on NAC's and a CPAP with oxygen.  

I held my own in 2009 thru part of 2011. I was able to change to basically using oxygen only at night.  At my last 2 visits (which is now only 1 a year) I was told that my condition was actually improving and they rarely saw this happen with fibrosis.  We finally confessed about the Cordyceps and ALA.  Even my Internist mentioned that he only heard the ""Velcro"" sound in 1 small area of my lungs.

"I began taking this mainly for it's immune- boosting function. What I noticed first was that the fungal infections that kept popping up periodically on my foot and the crook of my elbow (the tinnea variety) went away and haven't returned. I also noticed a lack of the usual seasonal sinus infections and irritation I get during allergy season. The most surprising was that while on it, in addition to a new habit of jogging, I lost 20 lbs. Obviously the jogging caused most of this, but when I ran out of Cordyceps for a couple weeks I noticed that despite my regular jogging I began to have cravings for fatty foods and treats and wanted to fill my stomach up as I had prior to losing weight. I began the Cordyceps again and my cravings diminished and was again satisfied with eating just enough and not stuffing myself. I found it easier to make good food choices. I notice that I seem to have less episodes of heart ""palpitations"" especially if I drink alcohol or coffee, as I did before. I do not feel a ""rush"" of energy from the pills, but have noticed I am generally feeling better, even with lack of sleep. I look forward to the treadmill, and it's hard to say, but it seems it helps my motivation in that. I have been taking Cordyceps daily for a little over a year. ","

"Cordyceps Sinensis the one most significant supplement that has saved my life.

I started taking 2000 mg daily in June 2018, reduced to 1000 mg Jan 2019.

Benefits of using Cordyceps.
1. Attitude went from negative to positive because of having so many medical issues. I was sick and tired of so many problems..

It now allows me to think cleary, analyse problems,  then deal with them in a positive maner.

2. I was on Prozack depression meds for years. I was able to get off these meds, 9 months later, I am still feeling great.

3. I was on medcation to reduce swelling of my feet, ( I have diabetes, I use no meds, I treat with diet only) after 2 weeks, no more swelling, I got off my meds. 

4. In 2015, after I had a extensive kidney urine flow test, I was diagnosed I had lost 72% flow in right kidney, 28% in left kidney. They were not filtering and eliminating body fluids,by 50%. My doctor had no explanation why this happened.

I think it was from using Metformin for my diabetes meds I was put on. My kidneys hurt very bad, I could only urinate 2 times a day, sometimes 3. No urge to go or never got up in the middle if night. Kidneys just did not want to work correctly.
My doctor had me stop the meds, I told him I will treat by diet only.
After starting Cordyceps, I noticed a gradual increase I urine flow.
I started going every 3 hours like clockwork, so long as I drank plenty of fluids, even getting up during the night.

5. My energy level has increased dramatically,  sometimes I only sleep for 3 to 4  hours a night, do not feel tired and down like I used to.

6. My memory has returned, I remember many things as far back as when I was 4 and 5 years old. My mind Is crystal clear and sharp, almost like having a photographic memory.

7. I can now deal with my pain issues.  Having many accidents, fractured spine, neck, femur, 2 barms. 1.5"" shorter leg, scoliosis & arthritus. Can now tolerate pain, I take much less pain meds.

Cures much more, this is my miracle supplement.","

Until 3 days ago I was having diarrhea and got fever. Then I consulted my doctor. The doctor said the cordyceps got heat effect on body of part of people and the cordyceps got no effects of the other part of people.
My doctor instructed me to stop consuming cordyceps for one month.
My suggestion is to consult your doctor before using cordyceps.

"Track & Field Athlete who took this on/off for 2yrs while in college. No enhancement of performance that good, well-coached practices could deliver. For a sprinter/hurdler/jumper, it was unneeded water weight with a well-hydrating diet. It was ""pushed"" by then track coach on the whole team.  I personally gained better results over the summers witout taking it.  It has been 15yrs since that time frame and it is more difficult to shed off water weight now from those of us who took it regularly than my teammates who did not take it.  Greater scientific class sizes over longer spans of time need to be taken to determine if it is really helpful or not.  Most test sizes have only come from groups of around 40(VERY small).  ","

"I have been taking creatine monohydrate for 2 months now. While I have taken the recommended dose (i.e., 5 grams a day, without loading phase), I have experienced great results (strength gain and no side effects). However, during that period, I decided to double my daily dose. Soon I started experiencing side effects: extreme fatigue (not attributable to dehydration)and cardiac arrhythmia (namely premature ventricular contraction -PVC). The PVCs occured in a isolated, but relatively frequent fashion (about 10 per day). I'm not sure if there was some kind of interaction effect between fatigue and PVCs. What I know is that I have always had irregular heart beat, and I guess it has played a key role in PVCs onset.","

"I bought a large amount of organic Damiana from a reputable source.  At first I tried smoking it, 3 cigarettes a day for a few days.  

Side note: I had been smoking blue lotus the day before, and I was taking a multi vitamin supplement, and a ginkgo biloba supplement.   I'm 26 and have no health problems.
   
I didn't really notice any effect, so I decided to make tea with it.  I made a Damiana tea bag using a coffee filter and 2 teaspoons of Damiana.  I let it steep for about 5 min. in a large mug, then slowly drank it.  After about 45 min., I started to get the feeling my kidneys were swelling up, and gradually that feeling got worse and worse.  I felt dizzy, nauseous and weak with a tightness in my chest, this lasted for 6 or 7hrs. I tried to throw up but couldn't.  I was considering going to the hospital.   These symptoms slowly started to go away.  Around 8hrs after I drank the Damiana tea, the aphrodisiac effect kicked in, it was sudden and VERY strong, an almost irresistible urge with a VERY heightened sensation that lasted for a little over an hour.  This effect was not worth the hours that preceded it.  I can't say whether it was an overdose, an allergic reaction, or a reaction to something else in my system, but I wouldn't want to repeat the experience.  If I were to try Damiana again, I would be much more cautious and use a much lower dose over a longer period of time.               ","

This is the only time I've ever experienced this in my whole life. Usually, empathy comes in a logical form first, but this felt like a psychic connection if there is such a thing. This, I *felt*. It was amazing and I felt so human. Unfortunately, subsequent intakes of the herb has not provided so much joy. I degrade further into depression and despair with subsequent use.

"I used to drink damiana tea a lot when I was in my late teens and 20's for a general tonic effect. I recently began taking it again for depression. I have major depressive disorder and have tried around 15 different types of medication for depression and mood stabilization over the course of the last 30 years. I am currently on Wellbutrin, Lamictal and Seroquel (for several years) but continue to have mild to serious depression 4 or more days a week. I've been drinking around 2-3 cups of damiana tea (around 2-3 tablespoons damiana leaf per cup) once a day over the last couple of weeks. It actually seems to work. I feel better and am regaining a feeling of excitement in everyday life, which has been totally lacking for years. Maybe this is why I enjoyed it when I was younger--before I succumbed to serious depression which has been with me much of the last 30 years. I would say it's worth a try if you have recalcitrant depression which isn't responding to other medications. Currently it is not boosting my libido, but increased sexual interest is not something I'm actively seeking at this time.","

"We made a flavored liqueur including vanilla  bean (important for best flavor) from brandy. It is delightful flavor and the amount of daminana can be adjusted for strength and flavor.  It is a mild diuretic.  It reduced neurological pain substantially for about 12 hours.  It made everything feel better.  Onset of the daminana effects was about 15-30 minutes after sufficient was sipped and the effect lasts several hours.  It enhanced sexual activity and earned it's reputation as a ""long life"" elixir.  The liqueur is made with both the alcohol extract and the following water extract from the same material which are combined.  In the completed liqueur there is a slightly higher density emulsion which settles out like in a ""wave"" tank.  If the golden clear liquid is poured off a substantial amount of effectiveness and flavor is lost so for best effectiveness it must be agitated to get both components in a serving.  With a doubled amount of daminana, water, honey and other ingredients, a serving of about 1.5 ounces of perhaps 30 proof or less liqueur is effective.  I find the combination of the alcohol extract and water extract to be much more effective than a simple tea, and can be a taste delight.  Making the liqueur is somewhat laborious but well worth it.  It takes about 2 months of aging for a ""mellow"" flavor.  Currently I utilize it once a week for the past several months. ","

"I use echinacea in combination formulas for sinus infections, which I started getting frequently 20 years ago (sinus surgery didn't help much). I am allergic to many antibiotics, so using an herbal approach is safer and even seems to result in fewer infections over time. I think using herbal remedies helps slow development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. And since I have asthma, preventing and shortening respiratory infections is key. 

There's a huge difference in effectiveness among brands and formulations -- most do nothing for me, especially those in tablet or capsule format. What works best for me are Zand Insure herbal extract (has glycerin so tastes far better than alcohol-only liquid extracts) and/or Nature's Way Sambucus Immune Syrup. I often exceed the recommended dosage with no side effects. I also do nasal irrigation with hypertonic saline. So glad I found echinacea combos! Hope this helps others. ","

"I have used this herb for over 20 yrs for various reasons. It works great for viruses but is not ideal for infections. The best alternative for antibiotics I have found (for bacterial infections) is a combination including golden seal. Many experts suggest taking echinacea for 2 to 4 weeks, then take a break of 7-14 days. I tend to have reactions to chemical antibiotics, so this is a great alternative. The suggested dose of two capsules usually is for the ""average"" wt person of 125-150 lbs. If I am  having symptoms I take 3 capsules two to four times a day depending on the milligrams.(Because I am not the ""average"")  Works better to stay on it for two weeks if I have symptoms. If I stop early, sometimes symptoms come back. As a rule herbs work better in smaller/routine doses with increased frequency, rather than doubling up on the dosage(not recommended.

I was carer for my Dad and Husband and had an operation on my thyroid. They were watching TV one morning and Dr. Chris came on and was talking to a lady who had awful colds since she had the same operation I had. Both my Dad and Husband had the Flu Jab but I was not old enough even though I had to look after them and my Doctor just shrugged his shoulders when I asked him about it. I have been taking Echinacea since 2002 and have only had one cold when I did not start taking it but that went away when I did. I take one tablet every day for two weeks then leave off for two weeks all through the winter and on day the two men had streaming colds but even then I did not catch one. My Dad died in 2003 and my Husband in 2007 but I still take Echinacea every winter. I have never had the Flu Jab either.,"

"The most effective use of Echinacea is to combine with Licorice and Vitamin C in 2,000mg dosage each. While Echinacea and Licorice intake can be repeated up to 3 times in 24 hours, Vitamin C should be limited only to once a day, and no more than 6 consecutive days, lest you should increase the chance of kidney stone syndrome. When you combine E and L only, you bet 17~26% boost from each compared to taking it alone in boosting your immunological capacity. In my experiences, taking them while my stomach is empty would make them work faster. This formula works even for virus-driven ailments such as flu, which defies most medications, because you are boosting your immunological defense mechanism. Although not experimented, post chemotherapy cancer patients should also benefit greatly in combating pneumonia, as chemotherapy destroys one's natural immunological defense mechanism in nearly all the cases, wherein you robbed Peter to pay Paul. This formula would cut the evil cycle there too. (Echinacea Extract 500mg by GNC)(Licorice DGL 500mg by GNC)(not in the list below)","

Have even used it on my pets. I have done a lot of sunbathing in my time and have a lot of sun damage, large pores and a reddened skin on my face and back, this has been amazing in soothing skin, giving me an even skin tone and minimising my pores, it hydrates skin and protects it with out giving you that greesy look or feeling, I just use a little when I remember too. Fantastic for burns and cuts put some on instantly and it is a miracle healer...I'm astounded with its uses and benefits, my Australian friend told me every household in australia has little pot of this. A little goes a long long way, can't praise it enough. I buy a triple refined variety, either off the internet or in local health food store. Have also started taking in the last 6 months emu oil capsules from emu oil well, they seem to keep my skin hydrated and moisterised from within too and my joints lubricated from my daily jog with the dog.

But I got older and still they were there so my aunt's husband at the time worked at a Emu farm and had received some oils.

"Emu Oil 
1st came to my awareness when I was looking into a natural healing for my gums. I learned about oil pulling with organic coconut oil. If you mix with coconut oil and swish in your mouth for 10 - 15 min DO NOT SHALLOW and then brush your gums will heal! 
2nd time was reading the bottle and saw that it effective on cuts and scrapes and burns, etc. Our Scottish Terrier dog had a hot spot that nothing else seem to be working on so I put Emu Oil and it stop the scratching and it healed FAST! Beware pets love to lick it. 
3rd I have lupus and Fibromyalgia so nerve pain which is hard to treat. Emu Oil helps doesn't cure but helps reieve the pain temp in the joint area 
4th I have rashes on my arm due to lupus and it has started healing my arms in less than 2 weeks 
5th I will turn 50 in 15 months and starting to notice aging in my hands and around my eyes. A week ago I put some EMU OIL in my creme I use on my face and hands and I notice a huge difference. ","

As far as for wrinkles on the face, it appears to soften them but so far that is all, it hasn't erased them and frankly, didn't expect it to.  Short of botox or other fillers, nothing is going to make them disappear.  

However, I also have arthritis and recently started having issues with small finger (very painful).  OTC meds do nothing for my arthritis, might as well take nothing as far as that is concerned.  However today after discovering that it has helped some other people, I gave it a try and rubbed one tiny drop (which is all you need) into my entire finger (top and bottom) and it has relieved my pain 100% (I kid you not).  For this reason alone, I will be buying it once my sample is used up.","

Dealing with health issues I look for hollstic ways to treat my conditions and have had good results and bad results. EMU OIL is GOOD results. I started out using it on my dog who had a hot spot and it cleared it right away. I then used it on rashes on my arms wow it a wonder drug one application and saw a big difference. I have Rx creme that doesnt work as well at this emu oil I have. I recently been using it on aches and nerve pain and been using other pain methods by a 1/3 less! So I would agree this is a litle wonder in a jar. Great to keep on hand. I would STRONGLY suggest to ensure you are getting the real deal and not some knock off. Purchasing from your pharmacy health food store is a great idea. ,"

I had also used it on my legs when I was bitten by a pit pull, a couple of years ago, at the time all they said was to put neosporin or some other antibiotic ointment that did nothing to heal it, or it would take a month before I would notice anyting. I havent got the patience for that, so I put a little emu oil on it, and did that for a week, 3 times a day, and it improved signifacantly much more than the neosporin. Its excellent for preventing scars, and making them less noticable. I cannot see the scar on my leg from the bite, and thats saying a lot. It cost over 20.00 but in my opinion its worth the money.  Also, this product is excellent for Bedsores, or any skin condition. I would use it at night so it absorbs better, and the emu oil product I use is Longview farms emu oil. ","

"docs recommend iron, calcium and other minerals and metals.  sadly, they suggest non chelated versions not bound to protein and thats why people often get sicker.  best way to increase iron levels or calcium levels etc. is to eat foods rich in them.  for iron, believe it or not, eat heavily at Wendys...that is a double hamburger and a bowl of chili, daily for 2 weeks.  Your iron level will climb a few points.  Ive seen it.  Food, except GMO which is poison, is natures way and your best way to health.","

"I lost my baby to a natural miscarriage at 4 months, and lost so much blood in the process my hemoglobin levels dropped to 7. I was adbised that the normal hemoglobin range for healthy young women is 11-15. I was recommended for a blood transfusion by an attending internal medicine dr, which I declined after consulting with my ob on whether it was truly necessary. My OB advised that iron supplements, over time, MAY help raise blood levels and I could try that first since I didn't demonstrate dangerous symptoms. He prescribed Bifera supplements, leafy veggies, red meat, and lots of rest. I took as directed, 1x daily on a full stomach, without dairy. No bad consequences of any sort. After 2 weeks of this, I had my blood levels checked - they were in the normal range. Im so glad i considered the option so i ddnt have to go through that stress of a blood transfusion. Now, I still take OTC iron supplements for general health and to help ease menstrusl fatigue. my dr said the OTC supplement works fine for that.","

"I am a white, auburn-haired, fair-skinned female from Minnesota. I had no energy. I could not think very clearly. I was laying down to rest 12+ hours per day late Spring of 2012. I was not sleeping very well. I would get winded very easily. I felt panicky sometimes at the gym, or simply doing relatively light activities. A medical professional later explained to me that I was air-starved due to lack of iron. I was put on an anti-depressant early May 2012; the dose was increased from 10 mg to 30 mg over about a 6 week period. The anti-depressant didn't seem to help. Finally a nurse practicioner recommended a blood test to check for thyroid issues, vitamin D and iron. My thyroid was fine. I was anemic,my iron stores were extremely low & vitamin D-3 was low. I was told to start taking an over-the-counter,45 mg slow release iron pill. Vitamin D-3 was increased from 1,500 IU/day to 3,500 IU/day  I felt MUCH better within a couple of days. Pretty much normal within a week. I was told the anemia would go away relatively quickly, but the iron stores take a long time to improve. I still take the iron supplement every day with dinner. I forget occassionally, but it doesn't seem to matter. Vitamin D-3 in the a.m. I called the NP & weaned myself off the anti-depressants over a 2 month period in Nov/Dec of 2012; that was a good choice in my case as I noticed no difference. After 3 months my blood was rechecked. The iron stores were still very low, but coming up. I have been told to get my blood checked about every 6 months or so to ensure the iron levels aren't too high or low as iron poisioning can happen. I need to lose about 20 lbs as a result of this whole episode. I'm not sure what caused the weight gain. It may have been as simple as feeling better and consuming too many calories combined with a new job & lack of regular excercise! Continuing with my iron supplement; regular excercise;  adequate sleep; moderation with alcohol & portion control are my focus now.","

"I began taking Krill because og the smaller size compared to fish oil, and was overwhelmed by the reponse I received.  I was suffering from severe inflammation caused by arthritis in my left wrist, it was so severe that it was causing carpal tunnel syndrome and I was scheduled for surgery.  No Longer, with the inflammation 95% reduced, the carpal tunnel symptoms went away.  I was totally surprised by the results and highly recommend this product.","

"I have taken fish oil capsules twice a day for a couple of years but thought I would try krill oil. My husband and I have only been taking the supplement for about a week and and a half. Within five days I started sleeping thru the night, had more energy, and most importantly, my joints felt great! (Following a hysterectomy three years ago, I went into surgical menopause). I have been severly sleep deprived since-night sweats, etc.-The past week, I have awakened refreshed and maintain the energy thru the day!I live a very active,hectic life.I work full time and take care of two elderly parents so I need all the energy I can get. I cannot believe the difference in my hips and knees! I would have described a feeling of inflammation in my hips and knees while on the fish oil, but not with the krill oil. I plan to check my cholesterol in a couple of months and will let you know. However, I'm fortunate that both my HDL and LDL are really good with a slightly elevated total cholesterol. I highly recommend krill oil to anyone with joint pain and currently three co-workers are taking it upon my recommendation. Hope it works as well for you and it seems to be working for me!! ","

Minor side effects of gas, and occasional loose stool, but minor.  Other side effects include very positive Cholesteral improvements and Triglicerides improvement.  Blood pressure continues to get lower.  I've also lost weight and improved my fitness training, so could be a side product of healthier fitness and diet.

I had run out of the krill and just started back on it only to have this reaction again right after taking it!  I do not have a known allergy to seafood, but now am worried to eat shrimp (which I love) and have never had problems with.  The rash is terrible and lasting after five days.  It extends all the way to my knee this time on my left side and feels hot to the touch and tight inflamed skin!  I am miserable!","

Within 2 weeks I noticed the pain in my neck from a whip lash injury last year was FINALLY gone.  It has to be the krill oil.  I've done PT, chiropractor, massage therapy and of course rest and have lived with pain everyday.  Now virtually none.  I also was surprised I had NO cramps with my period this month.  Last 2 months cramps were worse than my labor pains.  This month, not even a slight cramp. I pray to God they deem this vitamin safe to take FOREVER!!!!","

Last week, after having run out of my Superkrill for a few weeks, I went to the dr to get a referral to a foot specialist, someone who would treat me as a patient, not a customer as I've been down that road, because the pain is increasing.  I then scored some SuperKrill and two days later my pain is gone. Unbelievable! I've got an appointment in two months because they called me but In the meantime I think I'm okay.

"I used this Krill Omega-3 super formula for about two years. I did get the upset stomic and had heartburn, but I got passed it. I was feeling good while taking this. During this time I was in a fall and was given pain meds.  The heartburn and upset stomic got worse. So I stopped taking the Krill Omega-3 super formula vitamin. It Helped.  
Now I have severe pain in all my joints. Gradually the pain went thru my body. Started in my knees,then ankles, then elbows, then wrists and hands, fingers. Then to my shoulders. It is 24/7 in all joints.  I can barely walk, or stand without taking pain meds for this condition. I am afraid to start taking the Krill oil again due to the upset stomic. It was that bad, couldn't keep food down at all. 
 My question is: Did this Krill Omega-3 Super Formula cause this condition? I have never had any problems with my joints. Now I do, and it is crippling me. Could you please contact me at ","

"I have only been taking  Mega Red Krill for the past 30 days. Going next week for my blood work. My last colonoscopy revealed a mild case of diverticulitis. Dr. recommended to stay on a high roughage diet and I have and did not had any problems relating to the diverticulitis. I am now experiencing problems with diverticulitis. Concerned that it could be a side effect possibly from interaction with calcium and also pro-biotic. So, I have chosen to withdraw from all of the above and possibly reintroduce them, one at a time beginning with Krill. Also, will be reviewing these concerns with my Doctor in a few weeks. I plan on giving WebMD an update.     

My Brother has been taking krill for the past year and the Dr's were thrilled with his blood work. They reduced his cholesterol meds, and may eventually recommend Krill as a replacement. ","

I take you gels in the morning.  I have only taken  it for a month but the results are amazing.  I had no pain head to toe. All the inflammation from my psoriasis and the arthritis went away, it even started clearing the psoriasis on my legs that had spread 3 years ago. 
As an added bonus, my acid reflux went away and my heart palpitations stopped. 
I also dropped one pant size!!
Not to mention ladies, I am premenopausal and it keeps my mood stable and I don't have night sweats! Maybe my experience is different than most but this product has changed my life and I am more energetic and happy!
I have started to give it to my teen kids!
It took about a week before I started noticing a difference.   
The only side effect that I have noticed is a slight burp about 1min after taking it that all I can compare it to is a very mild tuna fish flavor but it went away immediately. 
I hope this helps someone. ...you have to be patient .

"Krill Oil seems to almost be a miracle drug for me. I believe 1000mg/day of Walgreens Suberba2 krill Oil has been responsible for 98% reduction in joint stiffness, reduction in dry eye problems and clearing up brain fog.  I had no idea O-3s could do this.

For various reasons I switched my usual breakfast from a fastfood biscuit to greek yogurt with flax & chia seeds mixed in. After reading a little about seed 0-3s and conversion to DHA/EPA O-3s I decided to look at fish & Krill oil supps.  Krill seemed the better option, fewer pills, less possible toxin, more friendly to env.  Picked up a bottle at Walgreens, figured 1000mg would be best bang for the buck.  I did not expect any noticeable improvements. My diet is crap and thought it could help my lipid panel #s.  About 2-3 weeks in I noticed that the Osteoarthritis pain (mild but constant) in my hands was gone, and that it generally was easier to move around. Squatting and kneeling is much easier now too.  Then I noticed that my head feels noticeably clearer and my sleep seemed easier.  Also Blephaeritis symptoms were better, still some gunk in the mornings, but lids not cemented together and no more excessive tearing.  

These results were totally unexpected.  I didn't know O-3s could do this (well I guess its the 3 to 6 ratio).  I've just finished the 30 tab Walgreens bottle and am switching to Sports Research from Amazon.  It too uses Superba2 from Anker Marine. Also will add a 2nd daily 1000mg tab to regimen, on top of the tablespoon of Chia/flax. ","

My reactions and results to the NO appeared to be as stated in product claims and warnings. Increased dreaming was one stated side effect that was easily accepted. I stopped the supplement when an acne issue developed after about 4 weeks.  I tried again 3 times with at least a month between attempts to make sure it was not another source causing the acne problem but each attempt correlated to an acne outbreak. Succeeding outbreaks happened much quicker than the first, usually less than 2 weeks. I took the recommended dosage in the first cycle but subsequent attempts were at a reduced dosage, about 1/3 less. I also tried a competitor's product since the positives really had me hoping for success. I never had much of an acne issue even when younger and at my age, over 50, acne outbreaks are rare. The outbreak was always in the face and neck areas and the whitehead lesions were large and quite painful compared to any I have had before. It is too bad since the positive effects of the supplement would normally have warranted continuing its use.    ","

"After dealing with CHF due to a viral illness I have searched high and low for something to help lower my BP without a interaction to my BP meds. I remembered this supplement from my weight training days so I gave it a shot as my doctor was looking to increase my meds otherwise. So with just 3 grams and just half my BP meds I keep a nice low BP all day long even after a hard cardio workout. It promotes the making of the Nitric Acid of which itself helps builds muscles and various other benefits, but primarily it dilates the blood vessels, very well IMO. I only take 3grams, have taken as much as 6 grams with no ill effects or jitters and it made the Wife very Happy. I am sure results may very, but I am sensitive to stimulants and until I can fully recover this has helped far more than words can describe.","

If you want something for CHF, then take magnesium taurate and TAURINE, or you can take taurine by itself because it will fix your heart whether it is WEAK, BEATING ERRATICALLY, etc.......l-arginine probably helps with blood pressure a little, but I am not sure about this either since I am in the process of ordering L-citrulline to increase NO which l-arginine is supposed to do.   But, I am disappointed with l-arginine since I get nothing from it to help with sex.  Green tea is much better for ED than l-arginine.

I feel generally better when taking it.   Dosage is 5000 mg when I think about it.   GNC has one container that is small, white and gold and it is overpriced.   They have another much larger micronized L-Arginine container that is red and black and it is like 3 times less expensive for the exact same stuff.   It used to taste terrible and made me nauseous to drink but it is now flavored thank God.   I recommend it but am not a Dr.   Use at your own discretion.   For me, it is 1 step short of viagra with no hangover affect.   All effects are good and my research supported that.   Like someone else said, L-Arginine in the AM and Viagra later in the day gives me best results.   I'm not sure we are supposed to take together because both lower blood pressure and too low is very bad (could even result in death if drops too low) so use together at your own risk or consult a doctor beforehand.   I used to have anxiety but overcame it.   It was one of the best things that ever happened to me because it began my search for the best methods for obtaining the best erections ever.   Plenty of rest, no fighting, low fat and low sodium the day of sexual activity with those two items together makes my wife and I two VERY happy mates.      I wish the same thing for everyone.   Please be careful and consult a doctor even if you are tempted to experiment.   No result is worth your health!   Good Luck!   :)","

"Given its mechanism of action most dramatically demonstrated in men with ED, it makes sense that circulation is improved overall. I was formerly dependent on furosemide ('Lasix') to dump excess fluid which accumulates because of poor blood flow to organs like the kidneys. I can now go up to a month without taking furosemide and my weight remains stable and I have no swelling of my ankles. I do take other supplements for CHF and what I experience is likely a result of the combination, but I do think L-arginine is a key component of my alternative medicine treatment program. Given that CHF is primarily a disease of older folks, males with CHF commonly have ED and L-arginine DEFINITELY improves things in that department. For older men with CHF, I can't think of a reason NOT to take it!","

"On my older brother's recommendation (our medical histories are similar) I started taking 2 grams of Arginine per day 3 years ago in combination with 12.5 MG of Metoprolol, 75 MG of Plavix (which I've been taking for 9+ years), 5 MG of Lipitor, a full dose enteric aspirin and 10 MG of Zetia. My relevant history: MI 9 years ago with 2 stents inserted, GI bleed 2.5  years ago ostensibly caused by aspirin -induced ulcer. I was taken off the aspirin at that time.  And finally, a 2nd bleed following routine outpatient inguinal hernia surgery performed laporoscopically (suspicion of nicked artery during surgery - received 2 units of blood). I was not even thinking about ED when I started taking Arginine so we can safely rule out a placebo effect.  Taking only 2 grams of Arginine per day, I still experienced a distinct ED improvement - I wasn't back in my 20s but I was certainly more functional.  But the best benefit was a virtual end of the angina which I was experiencing a few times per month.  I also noticed a slight improvement of my musculature without any additional exercise on my part. For me, Arginine has definitely been a quality of life improver and to my knowledge, I have not experienced any adverse side effects.","

I'm a 38 year old male who has had trouble getting an erection when sexually aroused.my girlfriend has wanted me to look into help for a few months.today I started taking 2000mg of nature bounty larginine.  Within 10 minutes and I'm not kidding my flaccid penis was ready to come to full attention. It has a mind of its own and thats great.i have been able to keep erect for several minutes and every time it goes back to being flaccid it pops right back harder than before. I'm so happy to tell my girlfriend about my results. I'll be ready to go several times tomorrow night.hope she's ready !!!!! I know I am!!!! The power of the nerves in the penis are so strong!!!!before to get erect I would watch the incredible hulk metamorphosis and my hard on would last 3 minutes.  Now my penis is hulking out,"

"I'm very happy with the result of arginine. I've been taking it with French Pine Bark as a result of this site and it seemed to work straight away, within 48 hours although I've heard it can be longer with others. I think the quality of the arginine is really important - there are some shonky brands out there, I think it's important that it has been made in the States and all the governmental guidelines have been followed. Email the companies, I did, you'll find a lot of it is simply imported from China and put in a fancy container. I've been taking 5grams of arginine with 150mg of french pine bark for three weeks now and haven't missed a beat. Good luck!","

"30 years old, been experiencing mild to moderate ED problems for the past few years. Hoped it would just go away on its own, it didn't obviously. Viagra worked out just fine but didn't wanna be dependent on it. Wanted to cure the cause, not the effect, blood tests came back good. Found out about the L-arginine / Pycnogenol combo on the net so I gave it a try. Only been taking it for about three weeks now but the effects are noticeable. Strong, firm erections in the morning, very easy to get it up any time of day. I take 2.000 mg L-arginine and 100 mg Pycno daily and I also add 300 mg of red ginseng, guess it couldn't hurt. So far been very pleased with the results, hope to continue on this good trend. I would totally recommend this to anyone with ED problems, because it has virtually no side-effects (I, for one, haven't experienced any).","

I've been taking lisinopril 10 mg. for hypertension for a few years. I learned that a combination of l-arginine and aged garlic would take care of high blood pressure as well and I decided to try it. I started taking both about 3 weeks ago and the results have been great. My blood pressure now fluctuates between 120 and 130 systolic and 60 to 68 dyastolic - which is great for a 72 year old like myself. I like the fact that this a natural approach to controlling my blood pressure and I no longer have to use a precription drug to do it. I'm achieving these numbers with only 500 mg. of arginine a day. You can up your daily intake til you reach your goal. And although I don't have an ED issue it's a nice benefit to boot.,"

"I had progressively worsening ED for 20 years, to the point of having an erection was barely possible. This combined with a strong libido makes for a frustrating existence indeed. I take l-arginine combined with l-citruline in 1000 mg tablets 3x daily as per label instructions. Be patient, as this takes fully 3 weeks to become effective, then look out. I awaken with a massive erection the likes of which I haven't experienced in years. It restored my puny atrophied penis size to what nature originally intended. Side effect: constipation, but seems to be alleviated. Anyone reading these tomes would be well advised to purchase a penis ring, as is assists in achieving an erection as well as maintaining one. It also assures satisfaction of your partner because of the increased longetivity it provides.  Hope this helps-good luck. ","

Was on amlodipine and valsartan for my blood pressure.  The amlodipine thinned my hair so I was desperate to get off it. Was under nitrous oxide for a tooth extraction and 2 days later went to my doc for physical and BP was 118 (normally I'm 135-145)...told the nurse no way please take it again and is was the same. So after researching the possible affects of nitrous oxide I found it could low the BP. So started taking L-Argine Plus by Elements with 5010mg of l-argine and 1010mg of l-citruline once a day and BP has stayed in the 115 to 125 range. I was able to ween myself off the amlodipine but not the valsartan.  Was shocked to find that no one has done enough research on the use of nitrous oxide to lower BP and use it for High BP therapy...it's not expensive but you know how some physicians can get.  My dentist is checking with her other fellow dentites to see if they have noticed this.  Bottom line is it works for me.,"

I am simply amazed with the endurance that I was able to sustain, and the recovery that it provided. Took some today before work and I was a little sleepy, didn't care as much, and less stressed. However, I am normally a very driven person and today I somewhat apathetic all day and didn't feel like working or care about anything really. Interesting amino acid I would say.","

"I have been taking chlorella for about 5 years sometimes taking 20 grams a day.  My most notable change revolves around digestion. It is a strange experience to feel an immediate  increase in energy after eating a meal. My body has been processing food more efficiently and this past winter (Jan 2010) I was sick for less than a day, actually had a fever that lasted only a few hours in comparison to a few days before I was taking chlorella so regularly.

I would suggest a very small amount at first, less than half a gram, since others whom I suggested taking chlorella had either allergic reactions or some of the nausea and diarrhea described by others here. I guess it does not work for everyone. ","

"It is also weird for me that people complain about Chlorella. I have been using it for about 5 years, and mom for 4 years- the results are amazing.So :
1.I think that not all brands of Chlorella are good and potent- I treid 3 different ones and one(Swanson's own brand) wasn't effective. So it's better if people specify the brand in their comments. I am very happy with Yaeyama Chlorella (Jarrow formulas). The other good one was Kyoto.
2.Some people might be alergic to it
3.This is just my hypothesis, but I think that if the body has a lot of toxins, it might not torelate the cleansing Chlorella.

I just got pregnant and I was trying to find if I should stop taking Chlorella. From what I read in the net I decided to keep taking it- I trust it completely.

(My husband gets the occasional skin cancer ""horn"" and I wanted help him and head it off for me too. I had no idea that it helps fibromyalgia too.) It's wonderful stuff.
It's not a toy, though, so do follow the dosing directions. You need to build up a tolerance in your system. I didn't, and ended up having a hypglycemic reaction. Then I read that it's good for lowering blood sugar too. Wow! It sure does! I hadn't paid any attention to that because I don't have diabetes.
I don't know what the dosing instructions for the tablets say, but if they're anything like those of the powder, the people who had bad reactions may have taken too much, too early.

I thought I must have picked up a cold even though I had no fever or typical cold symptoms.  I also became severely constipated.  After taking a four day break from the chlorella my ""cold"" disappeared and the constipation went away.  I hoped that these were caused by something else so took chlorella this morning.  Within 3 hours of the dose I started vomiting pretty intensely until nothing was left inside of me.

"While at family camp, my two-year-old grandson plucked a toxic wild mushroom and popped it into his mouth! Amazingly, a husband and wife MD, and Natural Doctor, were with us. They instructed us to immediately get activated charcoal into him, THEN, transport him to the emergency room. Activated charcoal was added to applesauce, which he readily accepted. He was transported, never suffering pain, nor ill consequences. He is now quite the healthy, active seven year old. Activated charcoal has also spared our family unnecessary pain and expense when food poisoning was experienced. The relief was almost immediate. I now keep caplets and powder on hand at home and camp. Though I am neither in the medical field, nor an expert of any type, I have given this information to you to let you know how we have been benefited by activated charcoal.

I had decided it must be the thyroid supplements so quit taking them (altho I've taken it for many yrs with no problems EXCEPT when a chiro had me taking extra ""natural"" thyroid supplements, which cause my 1st panic attacks which happened within 1/2 hr of taking them two days in a row! I was warned by several people, including a pharmacist, that over-stimulating the thyroid could cause these symptoms. This product should have a warning in the description and on the bottle! When I can't sleep I can't function. I have myalgic encephalomylitis (a very complex chronic illness which I used to call ""fibro/fatigue""), BiPolar II, severe chronic depression with anxiety, and am a hyper-sensitive person who has to be very cautious of any meds or supplements as I seem to over-react to just about everything.","

"I'm not certain why Ashwagandha affected me so negatively.  I had taken 2 on December 6th, and got terribly sick.  Intense vomiting, weakness and body aches.  At that time I chocked it up to a stomach flue bug.  In the back of my mind I kind of thought that the Ashwagandha had something to do with it that day, so I hadn't taken anymore.  This past Monday was my day off so I thought I would give it another try, this time I took 1 table.  In two hours I was vomiting intensely again, basically in the same manner I did on December 6th.  I couldn't function for the next 4 hours.  I continued to vomit and feel very poor the rest of the day.  And today, two days later, i'm still not feeling 100 percent.   
So, I did some checking and according to the information I found, it can effect those who take Thyroid medications.  When I was a kid I had graves disease and had my Thyroid completely removed and I take the medication Synthyroid for that condition.   I'm guessing that that has something to do with the reaction I had???

"Works well for me, using only a very small portion of Ashwagandha 500mg by Puritan Pride. Started with full pill, felt the relaxation or anti-anxiety quickly, and surprisingly a raise in mood/motivation later. Had some sweating, gained a couple of pounds, sparks of nerve pain in my toes and other places, and some other symptoms of too much steroids. After 2 weeks I quit for a week, and started at half the pill. Still too much, so now I take probably 1/10th of the 500 mg, in a gelatin capsule. What works for me is the improvement in motivation, then an improvement in the way my muscles work, and my blood pressure is lower. My appetite is a bit lower, but the 2 lbs weight gain may be fluid in muscle cells?? I still feel awful 1-2 days per month regardless of anything I do, probably due to cyclic systems I have no control over. Nerve sparks are gone, sweating too. Will continue.

And I thought about taking Ashwagandha to releive that feeling of my nervous system going haywire: shivery, restless, unable to relax, achy. I took three capsules and half an hour later, those symptoms subsided tremendously. If fact, although I'm running a temp of 102, I feel better than I've felt all day. Really amazing stuff. Try it! And no I'm not a salesman! But I did buy the little gelatin capsules from a reputable health food store (GNC)","

"The herb did what it said it would and made me clam enough to help me get some sleep... the problem however, would be when I would 'overdose' on the herb (2 pills). 

This causes me to hallucinate/lucidly dream, lose conception of space and time, and think that 12+hrs have passed when only 1 hr has passed.

In other words, it works but know your limits before taking more than 1 pill","

I originally took ashwaghanda for stress and anxiety.  It had a noticeable effect on my blood pressure lowering it on average from 130/85 down to 115/75.  It also helps with sleep- and when taken along with melatonin I'm out for 7 hours and when I wake up I don't have that groggy feeling when taking melatonin alone.  Also have tried Relora with no results and can say that ashwaghanda has been worth it. ,"

"I've been surprisingly pleased with Ashwagandha.  I had no expectations.  It was simply recommended to me, and I started taking it.  It has definitely aided in sleep.  I don't think it makes me sleepy so much as it reduces stress so that I can sleep.  Interestingly, it appears to have decreased my appetite during sleeping.  Before taking Ashwagandha, I would eat 2-3 times during the night.  Since getting it, I still wake during the night, but I no longer feel it necessary to eat.  Also, it appears to have stabilized my blood sugar levels during the day.  I have much less cravings for sweets.  As a result, I've been able to lose fat while maintaining muscle and strength.  Furthermore, it does appear to help with depression/anxiety.  Although I no longer take medication, I experienced greater results with Ashwagandha and GABA than I did with psychotropics.  Unlike some, I've experienced no negative side effects.  ","

This herbal supplement is the real deal.I had first purchased Abhwagandha due to all of the clinical studies that had proven its effectiveness in increasing free testosterone levels by 15% in healthy men. However, I unexpectedly experience very noticeable cognitive benifits such as sharper mental focus. I have always had sleep issues such as waking up in the middle of the night, sleep walking and even several episodes of sleep paralysis when I was younger.

"I've been taking ashwagandha (600mg organic pills containing the root powder) daily in the morning for generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and to boost my thyroid. (Luckily my metabolism is low. If yours is naturally high, this plant may cause you trouble.) The dose on the bottle suggests twice a day, but I've read enough material stating an effective dose can be as low as 450 mg.
Immediately after taking the first dose I felt sleepy, but this only happened to me once. I have noticed that I have more energy (have started to exercise every other day), and work has been slightly more bearable. (the dose I am using takes the edges off my social anxiety, but I am still uncomfortable).  
My appetite has increased a little, but I haven't experienced any negative sexual side effects.
I am not sure if this was because of the medication, but the first week I also created a schedule for my self to ensure that I get my tasks, work and personal care done in a timely fashion.

I can guarantee you your sleep will be better by 50 -100 percent but a little patience is needed. A month is enough to see visible results.

"I'm aware of this Ashwagandha medicinal benefits since I was a child as my father used to take it for general health and well-being.  I have also been taking it in pure powder form.  One needs to be aware that this gives a lot of body heat and can cause diarrhea and other side effects.  This needs to be balanced with some other nutrients and fruits that cools the system.  This is called ""Ashwagandha"" mainly because it gives  the energy that of a horse.  One also needs to get used to it by taking it for at least 15-20 to feel the benefits.  Side effects taken during the first few days are always there due to its high energy.","

"KSM-66 Ashwagandha plus 500mg capsules from Wild Nutrition, One capsule per day at morning for severe anxiety and depression. Miracle cure for last 5-6 months. This started to work for me after first few weeks, but did really notice huge difference for my wellbeing after 2 months. Increases the brain function, physical wellbeing, highly increased libido(in a woman,lovely orgasmic days), anxiety and stress reduction, but also night time insomnia and daytime drowsiness and fatigue. It does not take the anxiety away totally, but has made me able to manage quite well when nothing un-expected or stressful happens. During the usage I have noticed that my tolerance and resilience is only growing and I'm starting to trust that I can manage what ever happens. I do not feel that depressed anymore. It protects you from little daily stresses, but if something major happens it is not enough to cushion you from the impact fully. Which is super positive as nobody wants to become a zombie feeling nothing, but actually build more resilience and experiences. Like, 4 weeks ago something very stressful happened to me, my anxiety peaked up very high and found new forms of torment (shopping in Supermarkets started to become difficult and panic inducing + physical symptoms were becoming a norm). I thought that I needed to have some conventional mental medication and that Ashwaganda wasn't enough anymore. However I was too afraid to eat the mental meds, because my anxiety (+previous bad side-effects experiences). So it left me in just to increase my Ashwagandha intake to 2 capsules per day. It was too much and I got pretty bad nausea for a week. I went back to one capsule per day and I feel really good again! Did my 2 workdays very well and seems that I can manage again. So even that you you might get your anxiety peaking up it feels that I recover back to my ""normal"" level after period of down and I feel more at ease about everything. Also attending weekly counselling last 3 months.","

"I started taking this after I had a nervous breakdown a few years ago. I hadn't slept more than like 15 hours in over a month, my heart wouldn't stop pounding, I was constantly nauseous, and anti-anxiety medication only made me worse. My mom had some thyroid supplements with adaptogens like this in it, and I had read that it helped balance out your cortisol levels (stress hormones), so I took one or two a day. The first night I managed to sleep about 3 hours, the second 6 hours, and by the third night, I had slept through the night. After that episode, I began alternating between an Ashwagandha supplement and a tulsi tea with Gotu Kola (another adaptogen). I did that pretty regularly for a month. Now I only take the Ashwagandha when I feel like I'm spiraling. The supplements I take are 450mg per pill. I only took one or two with a lot of water. Start with the lowest dose; don't immediately jump to a 1000mg pill. Everyone reacts differently to these things. If Ashwagandha doesn't work for you, try one of the other adaptogens. I take this on top of watching my diet (greasy food, alcohol, sugar, etc.), deep breathing, being proactive, and journaling. This supplement probably won't cure your anxiety, but it will keep it from getting out of hand.
*Also don't get it as a tea. It tastes awful.","

One & one-half weeks later, I did my normal weekly INR (PT/PTT) to be sure my blood is clotting slowly enough. My INR was 1.1 (in the range for normal people). Mine is supposed to be 3.0 to 3.5 International Normalized Ratio(INR). I went to the ER to have hospital lab check my INR. Their reading was 1.0. MD recommended treatment (adjustments to Warfarin, and adding Lovenox injections) until my INR gets back to my target range. I realized that I had just been on astaxanthin for 1 to 2 wks. I have discontinued astaxanthin. I suspect it interferes with the liver's processing of warfarin. I'll update here when my INR is again in a therapeutic range.","

"I was looking for faster recovery and more stamina for workouts. It definitely delivered in that area but found after a while I couldn't sleep at night and became a little gittery which countered overall performance. The moral: take it in moderation ...Like every 2nd or 3rd day. This stuff is unlike any natural remedy I've ever taken.  Very potent!!

"I have been taking 8 milligrams of astaxanthin daily for about 3 years. I am very pleased with it. It has greatly reduced stiffness and pain in my lower back and joints. my cholesterol readings have also been very favorable while taking this product. However, I took other supplements to reduce my cholesterol readings at the same time, so I can't say exactly what effect this product had on that. the only downside I have noticed is a lowering of my libido. It's not gone, just not as strong as it used to be. Which doesn't really bother me since I'm single and not sexually active.","

Had been getting cortisone injections every 6 months for severe knee pain, when I started taking a daily supplement for an unrelated condition. Within a week my knee pain had almost completely disappeared. That's when I noticed that astaxanthin was one of the ingredients in the supplement.

"This supplement, as a part of a supplement strategy, has assisted in helping to improve my immune system (rarely do I get sick), has helped support more stable moods, helped maintain a better blood pressure (along with hypertension medications), helps with ageing (I'm regularly estimated by others to be 15 years younger than my chronological age (although genetics plays the largest role in ageing...the astaxanthin seems to promote healthy cell function including DNA), and my general health is better than its been in many years. I recommend this to patients with nice results for many of them. This is a powerful antioxidant, but is NOT magical. Users still have to eat properly, take care of their bodies, still need to use their brains regularly, control their weights, and exercise. The supplement is a good help, but will be a waste of money and time if people think that it will do the entire job of keeping their bodies healthy. ","

Also we were tackling type II diabetes with metformin and diet and Hgb A1C went from 8.5 (bad) to 7.2 (pretty good) over the same time.

"I experienced a reduction of arthritis pain in my hip after my first dose.  After reading the information on line regarding Astaxanthin, I am convinced that this is a supplement that I will continue to take.  The only side effect that I have noticed besides the reduction of hip pain is that my foot does cramp sometimes.  However, this is a minor thing and will not stop me from taking this supplement.  I classify the cramping of the foot as mild and I have experienced the cramps previously to taking this supplement.  I am very interested in the reported benefits of reduced inflammation in the body, the reduction of blood pressure, prevention and relief of diabetes, better resistance to colds, helps prevent heart attacks, prevents gum disease, boosts immune system, helps prevent the initiation of cancer cells, protects all parts of the cells from oxidative damage and helps prevent Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.  It can also help with cataracts, macular degeneration, glaucoma, etc.  I am excited about finding this supplement and will add it to my list of other supplements I take.  I take alpha lipoic acid, Vitamin D, co-enzyme Q10, fish oil, Vitamin C, red clover, a multi vitamin, Vitamin B, oil of oregano, etc.  I credit the use of these supplements that I have taken for over 25 years with giving me good health.  I do not take prescribed medication.  I bought the Astaxanthin from Vitamin World and the dosage is 10mg. ","

"This review is by no means conclusive. I am 59 yrs old, female, and wanted gen'l health improvement by taking this supplement. I took 6 mg of astaxanthin a day. I not only experienced irregular heartbeat almost immediately, but a tooth I'd had root canal on started to THROB within 3 days. I ended up having an emergency dental exam which showed nothing. I stopped taking the supplement after about 10 days, thinking the ""anti-inflammatory"" properties might actually help? A month later, I started on the same dose. Within 2 days, the same tooth was throbbing again, with an infection. I ended up needing an extraction of the tooth and surrounding tissues, which left a cave in that area, but hopefully all infection removed. Related to taking this ""anti-inflammatory""? I simply don't know! I stopped taking it for several weeks, and am now a month post tooth extraction. So tonight ... I started taking astaxanthin AGAIN! I seriously want all the health-related benefits (eyesight, hair/skin, digestive, etc.,). Now that I have NO more infected tooth to cause pain, I'm wondering how I'll tolerate the supplement. Would love to come back here in 2-3 mos of taking this supplement with a more conclusive update!","

None of this stopped the progression to WET AMD later in 2018 - it was a very fast progression. I don't know why it didn't work for me. I don't smoke, I eat carefully (keto style diet plus some fruit) and exercise and am mentally very active. I hear it worked for a few people. I don't know why it didn't work for me and I'm devastated and afraid of blindness - my prescription has been getting stronger and stronger. I am still able to drive and my ability for finer focus works if I'm using my glasses - maybe the astaxanthin is helping with that. ","

I have always not done well with meds etc. and get tired when told well no one else gets that through the years only years later to have it listed as side effect.

My research introduced me to Chinese source for herbs. I read about berberine. I found out our NIH has done research as well as other countries.  All positive. Rare. My GP does not support. I take 500mg 2 times a day of Berberine abd Turmeric supplement. In 1 month my A1C dropped to 8.4. I had to cut my prescription meds 50% (due to low blood sugar episodes).  I am slimming down. I have more energy to exercise. I feel like I have more hope and incentive to improve diet. Less animal fats for me helps - but is very hard to do.

"I started taking 3,000 mcg of Biotin a day to help my nails get stronger almost a year ago (end of August ’09).  It worked!  However I started having pretty severe headaches from it.  At first I thought the headaches were related to something at work (the start of a new school year, as I work for the school district).  However, it finally occurred to me after about 2 ½ months of frequent severe headaches and asking myself if I had been doing anything differently or eating anything different to cause them, that MAYBE it was the Biotin causing it.  

Coincidentally, I had started taking the biotin right about the same time as the start of the school year.  I stopped taking the biotin as soon as it occurred to me that it might be causing the headaches.  My doctor was skeptical that it was the biotin, but thought perhaps it was the ‘delivery system’ (the other ingredients in the pill besides the biotin).  She also suggested it might take a few weeks to get entirely out of my system and she was right.  The headaches did start lessening immediately, though.  After about 4 weeks, I was back to having the occasional sinus headache or tension headache.  

Just to do an experiment and to test my doctor’s hypothesis that it might just be the delivery system, after 6 months off the biotin, I tried it again.  I tried a different brand that my friend swore was the answer to her weak, brittle finger nails – and it had 1,000 mcg of biotin in it.  I decided to take only one (when I had originally been taking 3,000 mcg) and SURE ENOUGH, THE NEXT DAY I HAD A SEVERE HEADACHE!  Again, it took a couple of weeks for the frequency of my headaches to go back down to normal even after only one dosage of 1,000 mcg.  

It’s funny, I researched biotin on so many different websites before I started taking it and there wasn’t one mention of side effects on any of them!  I hope my experience will help others who might have this same reaction.

I also noticed a thinning spot at crown of my head Dr says could be blood pressure message and/or hormone issues from perimenopause.  I read about biotin and tried it.  Take 5000 mcg per day Natrol Fast Dissolve.  In less than 3 weeks I have no breakage and my hair is thicker at the root. My skin looks better as well.  Also take Bcomplex and Ginkgo daily. It's working wonders for me. ,"

"I am taking Biotin for type 2 Diabetes. I use it for its capability of delivering (uptake of) Chromium Picolinate to the body. Currently, I am using 2500 mcg's of biotin with 500 mcg's of Chromium. The combination of the 2 supplements has really worked well. Actually they seem to be working much better than Metformin alone. I have dropped my glucose levels during the day up to 25 points. I have settled into an overall drop in glucose of 15 to 20 points on average. In July I will have my normal blood work done and I am anxious to see what effect this combo has had on my A1c. My A1c has been hovering at a spread of 6.4 to 6.7 which I had already brought down by 3.7 points overall. I want to be over this nuisance (type 2 diabetes) as soon as possible and this combo has worked remarkably well so far.","

"I have been taking between 3000-5000mcgs of biotin inconsistently for years, and it has helped quite a bit. I roughly take it 2-3 times per week. I've been purchasing the 1000mcg tablets from Walmart and taking 3-5 tablets...HOWEVER, the last time I bought a bottle, I purchased the bottles that contains 5000mcgs per pill. I FORGOT, i switched up the pill type and accidently kept taking 3-4 pillls (roughly between 15,000-20,000 mcgs). And I think I actually took 5 pills a few times. Well here recently, I have been experiencing severe breast tenderness outside of my cycle and mammary gland irritation. I put two and two together and just literally figured out today I have been overdosing for a couple weeks. The breast tenderness has stopped and I am alright now, but how scary is that?! I researched biotin toxicity, and couldnt find much info because the research is lacking, but I know FIRSTHAND that breast tenderness is a side effect when taken improperly (my fault). I am so scared now, I will probably refrain from taking it ever again. I wonder what long-term biotin does to the breasts...I'm done son. And I thank God for helping me to make this discovery. ","

"I had heard that not only does Biotin help with hair loss but it helps with hair growth. For me personally it has not. It seems I am having greater hair loss (however after almost  a years worth of growth my hair has grown at a normal rate and is longer than when I started which could be why it appears there is more hair loss). The treatment has been easy to take but overall I could say I saw not real change. I have not underlying conditions, I was simply looking to grow my hair out faster and since I have fine hair I wanted to prevent the hair loss I was experiencing. I should note it is not substantial hair loss. From reading other reviews it seems to work for others with more of a chronic balding type of hair loss or those with other underlying (thyroid issues, Biotin deficiency etc...) conditions, since I didn't fall into either of those, perhaps thats why it didn't work for me. I do hope it works for you if you decide to use it. Good luck!","

"Biotin acts like a protein for the body. It will build up the nails and the hair and provide a source of energy for. With one tablet I noticed a lot of energy. It was good but it felt like a had a Red Bull. If you are taking Biotin for the hair, I would recommend using UNDER 5000 mcg and do not use multiple products with protein in them. Too much protein will weigh the hair down and it can break. Use a good mix of moisture and protein.","

"I began taking 5000mcg of Biotin a day(Spring Valley from Walmart)about a year ago to see if I could get some help with falling hair. Baldness does not run in my family,so when my hair began falling in heavy numbers,I searched about for a remedy. After 3 or 4 months of taking it,I began to notice an odd side effect-my nails were Breaking at a ridiculous rate. I had thought that Biotin was supposed to Strengthen nails?? But mine are as brittle as anything and I have to constantly keep them trimmed right down to nothing or they crack,chip and break at the slightest contact. My hair,btw,did Not stop falling, but my Facial hair did increase. Long hairs in eyebrows and quick growing beard, but no luck on the scalp.It's supposed to be good for Diabetics, of which I am one, so I will likely keep taking it,but as for hair and nails,it's sure not much good for me.Oddly enough,when hospitalized recently for an unrelated problem,Biotin was the Only supplement that the hospital gave me while there.Standing by the bedside,I looked down and the bed was Covered with fallen hair. Strange...","

* Could see results after 3 month (seems to take a little time -- nails grow)
* Used 6 months, to date
* 1000 mcg of CVS brand Biotin","

I stopped when I suddenly developed severe leg and hip pain. the pain was getting worse each day. It took several days to realize it was the Biotin and the pain diminished greatly when I stopped taking this junk and was gone in within days of not adding any more to my system.

"Started taking biotin 5mg 4 weeks ago. My hair is slow growing anyway but after a disastrous hair cut, holiday abroad and over use of bleached highlights I was desperate. 4 weeks on I am over the moon with the results. My hair has definitely experienced improved growth (I know from my roots), is softer, shinier and overall in better health. Don't be misled though. . .I have done other stuff to assist such as using a pure coconut treatment twice a week, eating a diet rich in nutrients to support hair nails and skin, reducing my use of electrical appliances(I am a slave to my straighteners) and cutting down massively on alcohol and caffeine. Also, I recommend infusion pro vitamin b5 treatment to assist . . .won't make your hair grow but will make it feel fab. 
I did have to bite the bullet initially and have a good 2 inches taken off before I started this 'grow my hair healthily' journey. . .but I reckoned it was worth it. I have learnt there are no quick fixes . . . If you want long strong healthy hair you need to commit but I for one am up for it as I am already seeing the benefits!!! Good luck xxx","

"I take 1,000 mcg dose of the fast dissolve ones. It taste like cherry with no nasty after taste. It also absorbed into my system. Faster than the other vitamin B complex I tried. I haven't measured with a ruler. But it has been three months, my hair stopped falling out by the handfull. And my hair grew from my shoulders, to the center of my back. My bangs were short and falling out. And now my bangs fit into my ponytail. 
Yes, I have mild achne, but regular face wash and a mild astringent gets rid of it. 

I'm only 23, so losing my hair after the birth of my son, was a big deal to me. But now it is thicker, way longer, and I'm so happy I tried biotin Fast dissolve by spring Valley.","

"When I began taking this megadose of Biotin, I was already taking it in a multi B complex, but not as much as I had read was necessary to reduce hair loss. I began taking 10,000 mcg tablets, until I found it was making my skin break out. I read that others had this problem, and so reduced my intake to 1000 mcg 3 times per day. Side effects went away. While I do other things to make my hair healthier, I believe Biotin has improved my hair length beyond any length I have ever been able to grow my entire life, and overall thickness has improved. No more breakouts, since I reduced the dosage, although I have read that if you gradually increase, your skin will not break out. I plan to try that, and will update my review when I do.","

I started using Biotin in hopes to grow out my hair since it takes as much time to grow as it takes a turtle to go around the world and it would break off a lot too. I started in August with the 2500mcg pill that melts in your mouth. The cherry flavor did not have an after taste at all; my nails became much much harder and longer; my face isn't breaking out besides during menstruation and I barely drink water; but my hair was growing just not as fast as I wanted so I doubled my dosage and everything is better now. I want to go into the 10000mcg dose after the one I have finishes. hope it grows even more!,"

"Does it work overnight and produce miraculously lush, thick hair?  No.  But as a woman with thinning hair, a receding hairline in places and hair frankly just falling out rapidly due to meds I'm on... I'm very pleased with the turnaround.  I saw thin hairs begin to grow at my temples first, and eventually noticed my 'part' was less noticeable.  It's also nice to be able to want to wash my hair again and not feel like I'm accidentally removing all my hair.  My nails are a bit stronger too, although not a huge improvement, just a slight extra perk.  What I wasn't even aware is I'm borderline diabetic and perhaps this will help with that too.  Oh, I did try to stop taking it (i.e. forgot to repurchase when the bottle ran out) and saw the hair problems come back -- so I won't be stopping this vitamin again.  By the way, I chose Natrol 10,000mcg after doing research (which I see isn't on the list so I had to select their 1000mcg here).  From what I read it's not something you can really overdo.  It's also only 1x per day and a smooth round pill easy to get down.","

"I regrew my hair and you can too. -I've been bleaching my hair on and off since forever. My hair wouldn't grow any longer it would just snap off. I've dreamed about having thick, long hair. And when I say dreamed, I mean it quite literally. So i decided to do something about it. My friend suggested Biotin when we were talking about my hair loss.
I’ve tried like 4 different brands until i found that the best one for me. Now i’m 26 and I've been taking Biotin every day for years.  My hair and nails grow SO much quicker. Hair has increased in the rate and are so long now. 
Also my energy levels are high. I remember that at the beginning i did heavy cardio and interval training which helped me lose weight fast but i did not realize how biotin played a part in my weight loss until AFTER i stopped working out. I continue to take biotin every day and now that I am no longer on my diet i eat whatever i want and i don't gain weight. It appears the biotin may be keeping my metabolism to the level it was at during my training. So i highly recommend it to you. For me the best is www.certifiedbiotin.com my friends also use this one.

"I came back to add some more information about my experience with biotin and to urge all of you with thinning hair to try this treatment. It has been a life-changer for me. I no longer worry about whether my hair is arranged properly to cover all the balding areas, I no longer worry about going out in the wind or the rain or the sun -- all of which can reveal thinning hair. And, I look so much younger with a full head of hair. It really seems like a miracle, because now I have completely normally thick hair after having had badly thinning hair for approximately 45 years! Here is the additional information I wanted to share: (1) As I have continued to use biotin, my hair has continued to thicken and it just never seems to shed any more. (2) I use whatever kind of biotin is available, not necessarily a particular brand name. Lately, I have been buying ""Nature's Bounty"" from Sam's Club. (3) I take one (1) 10,000 mcg gelcap-type dose per day. (4) You must tell your doctor you are taking biotin -- make sure the information is entered on your chart, because the use of biotin can affect the results of your blood tests. I had told my doctor I was taking biotin and it was on my chart, but when I went in for my most recent physical and lab tests, the doctor called back and said my thyroid function looked a little off, which he said might have been due to the biotin, and he had me stay off the biotin for four (4) days and then come back in and take the test again (which was fine). So, do tell your doctor you are taking biotin, and lay off the biotin for several days before you go in for lab tests so you don't have to repeat the test the way I did. Anyway, I do urge you to try this stuff -- it truly is a miracle and has made me feel so much more confident about my appearance!","

"I have suffered thinning hair for many years. I have used Rogaine ever since it came out, but it did not thicken my hair much. I began taking Biotin about 6 months ago. For the first 3 months, I felt my hair was thickening, but only slightly. I figured I needed additional help so I began taking some of the supplements listed in the famous Bargello's Vitamin Regimen (Google it). I have taken a multivitamin for many years along with a Vitamin D supplement, so I added MSM, Evening Primrose, and Flaxseed Oil to my regimen. (No real science to my choice of products; I just went to Natural Grocers and stopped buying after my total reached $40.) I also added Vitamin B-12, based on some online reading. I have not added iron although some sources suggest it might be helpful. I have had no side effects at all, except -- about a month after adding the supplements, I experienced the worst shed of my life. My hair line receded (even more) and my hair thinned all over my scalp. With some careful teasing, artful arranging of the hair, generous application of Toppik, and lots of hairspray to keep everything in place, I was able to camouflage the shed enough to ride things out. It took about a month of misery and self-consciousness, but now my hair is growing in thicker than it has since I was a youngster! My hairline is filling in and there are no thin spots anywhere on my scalp, and the hair that is coming in is not the thin, fragile hair you get after your hair follicles have practically shut down, but robust medium-coarse hair and with no shedding to speak of -- I see only about 5 hairs in the sink after I comb my hair and arrange it, when I used to see at least 20-30. Honestly, it's as if the terrible hair shed I went through earlier was just this great new hair pushing the old stuff out of my follicles! It is SO GREAT having hair again! Try it for yourself!  ","

"I have taken low doses of Biotin for about 20 years; about 1,000/2,000 without any problems and great results.  After taking Wellbutrin for abouta year, I noticed gradual hair loss.  I stopped taking it and felt desperate to regain my thick hair.  I choose to buy Biotin 10,000 to speed up the process; big mistake!!!  Within a few months,  my scalp became itchy.  I sought treatment and help, but no doctor could determined be the cause.  I was told to use dandruff shampoo, which never helped.  A few months later, I began having itchy patches on my body; mainly my elbows, knees, low back, outter thighs and my stomach.  Again, I asked a few doctors for help and was told that I have Ecezma for the first time in my life.  I used the steroid cream without much relief, so began feeling hopeless and depressed.  The itching is so bad that I rarely get a good nights sleep.  

Long story short, I threw out all of my vitamins, thinking it had to be an allergic reaction to one of them.  The only one I kept was the biotin 10,000.  As my itching didn’t subside, I finally realized that it must be the biotin.  I did some on-line research and found that doses over 2,500 can cause skin eruptions, itchy rash and scalp!!!!  I have stopped taking it, and the it hi g is slowly becoming less severe.  I am truly hoping that gmo has only get better, as I have been determined to find the cause if my itching.  I have never had this issue before, and pray that I have found the reason.  So far, so good!!!  I can see that they don’t even list a Biotin 10,000 below, so picked Natures Bounty 5,000, so x2 a day!!!?? ugh!!!    I am just hoping that I can spare someone the anguish that I have endured.  More is definitely not better, and just because Amazon sells it doesn’t mean it’s safe.","

It was recommended for my asthma which could be fairly severe at times.  I was extremely skeptical but tried a formulation by Paradise herbals and have had consistent relief from shortness of breath and wheezing within approx .5 hrs of taking a dose.  The results are better for me than inhalers like xopenex and symbicort which work for a couple of days and then stop being effective.  I'm certainly not suggesting anyone else should give up an inhaler that works for them but I'd tried almost everything and was getting no relief except for from oral steroids.  Have tried other formulations from other companies and have not had the same response.  There are other ingredients which could be responsible for the effectiveness- I don't know.,"

The taking of the Bomelain has shown a reduction of CRP's measured in blood from as high as '47' (during an acute inflammatory episode of the GI) to as low as '1' in a matter of one week.

Before taking the Bromelain the period of elevated CRP (as one marker)in blood, and pain and GI inflammation, was significantly extended during such an episode.

"On an episode of ""The Doctor's"" they explained how Calcium makes you loose weight (especially if you are 50 and over) or in menapause! An average women between 50-70 should intake a minimum of 1200mg of calcium per day (either in their diet or by supplement).

"After watching a documentary on this product I bought a bottle at my health food store.  The suggested use is six tablets daily so I started with three at bedtime.  I woke up one night very nauseas, but after noticing my adult acne was clearing up I thought I'd continue but take it after a meal. Taking three tablets after a spagetti dinner was not a good idea.  I had projectile vomiting about an hour later, felt nauseas all night and barely slept, then more vomiting in the morning. Because the benefits of this product are so highly rated, I'd  like to find a good dosage that works for me without causing nausea. I plan to scale back and take just one tablet a day and see how that works.","

"I've been taking Yarrow Formulas Yaeyama Chlorella in dried powder form, beginning with 1/2 tsp a day and then building to 1 tsp, which is the daily dosage suggested by my naturopath. Since I'm an organic eating vegan and consider myself very healthy and relatively detoxed already, I haven't had any real side effects. I could see, however, experiencing some rather uncomfortable headaches and nausea if you are very toxic in your system and then slam in the Chlorella all of a sudden.

Before taking Chlorella, I took Klamath Blue-Green Algae for years. Like all algae supplements, it's very important that you get a product that isn't contaminated.

In my experience, it's the contaminated products that make people experience the harsh symptoms like nausea, vomiting, etc. As WebMD states in their own description of blue-green algae in general, ""blue-green algae products that are contaminated are LIKELY UNSAFE...Contaminated blue-green algae can cause liver damage, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, weakness, thirst, rapid heartbeat, shock, and death. Don’t use any blue-green algae product that hasn’t been tested and found free of mycrocystins and other contamination.""

I guess others who wrote about having these symptoms might just be allergic rather than hitting upon a contaminated product, but for me, I've had no problems with the Yarrow Formulas so far. Only time will tell, as I just started on this one, putting it in my morning smoothie along with Reishi, Chaga and Astralagus Root.","

"I've taken Chlorella for 8 years now. It has to be the best immune system booster I've ever used! I have 3 kids and with a very busy lifestyle, even when I get worn down, they may catch everything going, but I have stayed healthy! My fibromyalgia is manageable, and much less flare ups since I've used this. I remember the 1st month being tough, diarrhea, and stomach cramps, but I know that this was my body detoxifying. Afterwards, I felt my body getting stronger, more energy, better sleep at night and no more getting sick. (sometimes I feel a cold or flu coming on and I just take more chlorella, and the next day I'm better!) I worked my dosage up from 5 per day at the beginning to 12 tablets per day now. I use Dr. Mercola organic chlorella - the source is purest and it's the most effective and costs less than many out there. I HIGHLY recommend taking it - it has changed my life, and now my entire family uses it. Worth the 1st month of feeling kinda crappy, stick it through, it will work for you!","

"I know that not all health supplements are equal, but that said, I would like to offer that the reason some people get sick when they consume chlorella is not the brand, but because they are very toxic and the when the chlorella begins to release the toxins, people will experience nausea and other very negative reactions.  It is very important to start very slowly with the smallest dose possible and then build up the doseage.  Note your symptons and if you experience sickness, know that it is caused by the release of toxins.  You may have to stop for a few days, or unti your system settles down, and then begin agin. Take the mimimum dose and continue with the same routinue until you can proceed with ease.  Always go slowly, take a break if needed, do not force yourself,cbnrb if you feel sick. Remember, toxins are poisens that you have stored in your body for a long time. Chlorella is a food and offers many health benefits.  It is worth giving it a chance.  BTW, the small 200 mg. tabs are easy to swalllow.  Give them a try.  ","

"My chiropractor recommended this, after being sick much of the fall semester this year. She told me it would boost my immune system, keep me regular, and give me the nutrients I needed that I wasn't getting from eating at obscene hours, and not always having the resources to make healthy choices. I was surrounded by people with the stomach flu most of the holiday season, and I am happy to report that I am so far flu free. I haven't experienced any major side effects. I started with 2 pills for 2 days, didnt notice any major symptoms, 3 the next two days, had some 'detoxifying' results. Bumped it to 4 for a day and now have been at 5 pills since (my bottles suggested amount) There are definitely some detoxing effects, but I haven't felt even close to projectile vomiting or a need to wear depends like previous reviews. I believe a lot of side effects are psychological. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 star effectiveness is because I have only been taking it a few weeks. So far I'm impressed, I hope it helps you too! ","

After 6 months I felt 100% 
better, I still take Sun Chlorella, and Milk Thistle, also Kelp , spirulina, and vegan diet, I have tried other less expensive brands of chlorella, but none worked like Sun Chlorella.
The comment about nausea after taking Chlorella was well clarified by next comment.
The toxins in your body that you are exposed to every day are ""toxic""!!! The nausea you experienced was your bodies response to releasing the toxins, milk thistle is a liver detoxifier, research it, Chlorella is the very best medicine you can take !!!","

"Every time that I took this supplement(in a smaller dosage than prescribed on the bottle) I became nauseated and would vomit until having dry heaves, but I didn't relate it to the chlorella as it would happen several hours after taking it and I was not aware of this possible side effect. We finally figured it out after my being sick off and on for two weeks with the most severe episode almost killing me as I went into hypovolemic shock from vomiting so much. My blood pressure was unobtainable. I think this is a very dangerous product and if used then only under very close supervision of your physician.I was unable to find the brand name of the product I used in your list.

"Hi, after taking Chlorella {Broken Cell} Tablet form, for two weeks for detox purposes...Starting very cautiously with 1 tablet on day one... Two on day 2, and so on, up to the max dose of 5 recommended on the pack! I take my 5 tablets 30 minutes before my main meal of the day. I have experienced NO side effects what so ever! I work 9hr night shift {Truck Driving} with manual work included... and have found that my digestion and and general health seems to be improving as yet it is early days for me, But... so far so good! For those who are suffering with side effects... I would recommend starting with a minimum dose, and slowly increase to the maximum as advised. The toxins in our body are deep rooted and have took years to build up... We can't expect to get rid of them after a few doses of detox tablets. All people are different and as with all treatments our bodies will react differently... This is to be expected. Be patient and give the treatment time to work for you, try not to expect immediate changes after a couple of doses! Good Luck with it... It certainly seems to be doing what it says on the packet... for me!     ","

It does look totally hypoallergenic to me (I am a registered nurse) but it is in a base of chlorells. The first day I took one capsule & thought I had somewhat increased energy but had to take medication for diarrhea, also had nausea. The second day I had so much back pain, stomach pain, & chest pain I was unsure if I would be able to continue driving safely to work. I was off today and took it again, with so much pain in my back & chest, nausea, bloating, & ill feeling right after taking it that I had to stay flat on my back for several hours. After researching chlorella online, there is evidence that it can make autoimmune conditions like fibromyalgia WORSE ... it can cause serious side effects like vomiting...& I will never ever try it again. I personally do not think it is worth it. And I do not believe it is brand related because NutriBiotic is a great company & I have taken other supplements by them in the past without any problems whatsoever.","

"I have mixed feelings about the product.  I think I experienced the serious negative side effects almost immediately after consumption.  I needed this product to help me detox ""toxins"" in my body -- mainly, candida and possibly mercury. I am also trying to decalcify my pineal gland. I so needed this product and wanted it to work in that I tried using it on 3 different occasions (varying the dosage)but with ultimately the same results.  Taking a lower dose, I was less sick but experienced the unpleasant side effect of nausea before the other symptoms hit.  The main unpleasant symptoms?  Repeated vomiting and severe diarrhea (coming out of both ends simultaneously -- I know, too much information).  Retching to the extent of having a sore throat the next day.  Lying supine on the bathroom floor for hours feeling intensely weak and ill.  At least, when I lowered the dose I didn't think I was going to die for the side effects and they did not last as long (3-4 hours vs 8 - 10).  My belief is that supplement worked but that my system is so riddled with ""poisons"" that the die-off (mainly of candida) was too much for my system to handle.  I experienced similar symptoms when I finished the protocol of hydrogen peroxide (food grade) therapy but that took 3 weeks to build up to the dosage that would cause the candida to ""die-off"" which of course, inundates your system with toxins and feels like (I imagine) heroin addicts must feel when they detox -- it is a living nightmare and you do feel like you may not survive it.  I wish I could tolerate the yaeyama chlorella that I took because I think it does its job, its just that the side effects are immediate and intolerable and consistently happen.  I can't seem to work my system up to accept it even at low dosages. Oh well.  ","

"I have been taking Kyoto Chlorella sold by Swanson for some 15 years. I do not have any specific reason for taking it, except that it is supposed to promote good health. I take 10 tablets with each meal for a total of 30 tablets per day. I am 84 years old. My health is  excellent. Bood pressure normal at 115 to 125 over 70 to 85. 
I eat a Mediterranean/ Chinese diet, minimize red meats.. lots of vegetables & fruits. I exercise daily and get 7-8 hours sleep every night. I would not credit chlorella for my excellent health, I think it is my over all lifestyle that contributes to my good health. I am also mentally active, working to maintain a good income. ","

"I have been trying to deal with eczema on my hands for years. It was very difficult because I am a registered nurse and sometimes my hands got so inflamed that I had to take time off work. Since I started taking chlorella and spirulina supplements together, my eczema is under control. I have been taking it for 3 months and have not notice any side effects. I am taking Health Force Nutritionals spirulina and chlorella in tablets. I always had great results with all the Health Force Nutritionals products. ","

"I have been using chlorella for over two years now, and my energy levels have soared through the roof, i am 48 years old and have the energy of a 25 year old, cannot imagine a day without it, I would definitely recommend this to any one who needs a boost, and the health benefits are huge, i take 6 chlorella in the morning before breakfast, although when i first started with a small amount, and worked up to this amount, also has helped me reduce other pharmaceutical medications that i have had to take over the years, like pain killers and anti depressants, can't rave about it enough, just wish i had used this earlier. feeling healthy makes every ones life richer.","

I take 1000mg tablets most I get is stinky bowel movements and my urine as went totally clear.   I am taking it to increase the alkalinity of my body and lower my uric acid.  I do find it funny reading these reviews and willing to bet all the ones who had problems read this crap first and have a placebo effect.  Don't read these reviews and get scared off.  Day one I took 2000mg no problems and went to the recommended 3000mg a day.   I take them before I eat or drink my Herbalife shake.  No problems to report just feeling 1000x better sleeping better and feel motivated!  Worth every penny!!!!,"

"I took Organic Broken Cell Wall Chlorella for one month. I had no side effects. The next day when my dose was over - my feet broke out in bloody open sores and they felt like they were on fire.  I have found out that Chlorella is supposed to attach itself to heavy metals in your body and then it is expelled through your urine and excrements.  I have 2 broken ankles with metal implants - the chlorella attached itself to them and my body has been fighting that for 4 months now.
What to do?  Any ideas? My feet also leaked lymph fluid as part of the attack. My skin is coming off a lot now.","

"Is Chlorella a powerful Natural Detoxification tool - Mercola, Feb.2012 I did not read this before I used it for a month.  At the end of the month I had bleeding open sores on both my feet and they felt like they were on fire.  What I guessed was that it attached itself to the metal implants which were in both my feet because of broken ankles,  The ankles were not broken at the same time they were broken  more than 20 years apart, yet the reaction was the same my left foot only had a few implants and was better but the right ankle was badly mangled and the right foot was totally covered on the top with these sores.  It will be 4 months since Oct.25 - when this happened.  My feet have gone through many different things the last was that they leaked lymph fluid all over.  The leaking has stopped but there is extensive peeling of dead skin most of which was caused by the last episode.  My feet are being treated by a nurse who comes to my home every 3rd. day - now we are using coconut oil to keep the skin soft and to let the skin come off whenever it is ready.  I wrote a warning letter about this to anybody who happens to have metal implants anywhere on their body.  Dr.Mercola from whom I purchased the Chlorella is supposed to have done some scientific experiments of it since Oct.25  I do not know the exact results but his Chlorella as been ""out of stock"" since then""","

"The directions sent with my sun chlorella said dosage was 15 pills safely per day for an adult. I started with only 4 in a.m. and 4 p.m. Stomach first day ok. Second day it became extremely bloated, agitated, gas and constant nagging churning/spasming. I called Sun and phone rang then would disconnect with busy signal all during business hours. I stopped taking pills after 4 days of huge discomfort. Emailed company. They sent me back sorry for your problems sometimes this happens. Sorry we didn't include directions for proper dosages. I sent second email today asking for product return instructions. I will never take this product again. It is very expensive and made me sicker than anything else I have ever taken for better health.","

Unfortunately I started having cramps, gas and diarrhoea, at first I didn't link the two but by looking into my diet which is healthy all pointed towards the supplement and after looking on the internet it confirmed my suspicions. we'll see how long it takes to settle.

I use this product for my stomach. I have all kids of issues I have diverticulitis and also told I have irritable bowels (what ever the heck that is ) Any my issue is what's he poop of the day seems like. My stomach will feel sick all the time in all places above my belly button by my rib cadge (yes I do get heartburn ) the middle of my stomach other times makes me feel so sick and the worst is when I eat stake which I love . When I eat steak my stomach will yell where the hole table can hear it before I even leave the table. Then comes the middle of the night on the toilet major cramps hurting so bad I feel like I have to push on my lower stomach to get it to come out I can sit there for over an hour until I go and try to go back to bed and I am back in there again .. by morning I am so tired and feel so sick to my stomach I don't want to do nothing. I also tend to have the runs a lot and poop like 5 times a day its crazy. I do drink beer a lot and pepsi also so who knows whats truly causeing this but I want to be honest with the things that I have noticed that may be causing all this. Any I started using Chlorella and took 15 pills like the bottle told me and no issues just my regular morning poop :) since I have been taking it all of my stomach issues are gone completely its amazing. I used this product may years before and it worked then also I took the hole bottle and never bought more but my bad life style habbits have not changed and so what ever is truly going on in my stomach came back but years later. This stuff is amazing ! I am thankful that I found something that works . My local health food store guy told me about it and I bought it even thou I was thinking ya right lol so glad I did !  ,"

"I take Bio2go Organic Chlorella.

I realize quality is mostly important. It is because chlorella can bind with the toxins in your body, so it also easily binds with toxins in the environment.

Different quality of chlorella works totally different. Bad quality chlorella gives me headaches and nauseous. Their chlorella has been the easiest one for me to use.   

Do you research before buying chlorella, find out where is the country of origin, and ask for a copy of COA.

I have been taking chlorella on and off for about 8 months for Fibromyalgia and mercury amalgam fillings removed a year ago. Its the only thing that helps me. It lessens the pain some and gives me energy from the vitamins and protein it contains. I know it is slowly detoxing my body with more frequent bowel movements. I also had a sebaceous cyst that cleared while taking chlorella. It does give me more gas and bloating and that is because its working to clean up the mess in my gut. I use Nature's Way non GMO chlorella.,"

"I use Prime Chlorella from Canada.  It is primarily sold in bulk and you can get it online or from health professionals.  Prime is very pure; I have used several brands and this is the best I have found.  Recently it has helped me with metal detox but I have used it for digestion and energy issues and take it when there is some extra stress in my life or I just feel the need. Do research before taking anything; chlorella is a wonderful nutrient dense food, but its important to know potential interactions.  The Japanese, (little island/lots of people needing food, :-)), and NASA, (easy food to take into space), have done good research on chlorella. ","
